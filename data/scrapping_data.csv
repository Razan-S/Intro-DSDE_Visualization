This alignment represents a 3.7σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios (MP/M∗subscript𝑀Psubscript𝑀\,M_{\rm P}/M_{*}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT<<< 2×10−32superscript1032\times 10^{-3}2 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement (λ=41.8−2.0+2.1𝜆subscriptsuperscript41.82.12.0\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}italic_λ = 41.8 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 2.1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 2.0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT∘). However, the relatively large Gaia Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high MP/M∗subscript𝑀Psubscript𝑀\,M_{\rm P}/M_{*}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT  systems is likely primordial rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment.

Journey to the center of the common envelope evolution,"Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution are often terminated soon after the initial dynamical plunge of the companion transitions into a long-lasting post-dynamical inspiral with slowly varying semi-major axis, absubscript𝑎ba_{\text{b}}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This premature termination is often due to insufficient numerical resolution and challenges associated with the softening of the gravitational potential of the two cores. In this work, we use statically-refined 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study binaries orbiting inside a common envelope, exploring the effects of varying numerical resolution, δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ, gravitational potential softening prescriptions, and the associated softening lengthscale, ϵitalic-ϵ\epsilonitalic_ϵ. We find that quantities such as the binary inspiral timescale or the volume-averaged shearing rate typically converge to asymptotic values only for ϵ≤0.1⁢abitalic-ϵ0.1subscript𝑎b\epsilon\leq 0.1a_{\text{b}}italic_ϵ ≤ 0.1 italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and δ≤6×10−3⁢ab𝛿6superscript103subscript𝑎b\delta\leq 6\times 10^{-3}a_{\text{b}}italic_δ ≤ 6 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with smaller ϵitalic-ϵ\epsilonitalic_ϵ requiring correspondingly smaller δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ. This suggests that many of the contemporary simulations could be effectively under-resolved. After a few tens of binary orbits, the two cores become surrounded by a corotating, nearly hydrostatic gas structure, resembling the shared envelope of a contact binary. We propose that this structure is responsible for the slowing down of the dynamical inspiral, leading to an asymptotic inspiral timescale of approximately 105superscript10510^{5}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT orbital periods for a binary mass ratio q=1/3𝑞13q=1/3italic_q = 1 / 3, and approximately 106superscript10610^{6}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT orbital periods for a binary mass ratio q=1𝑞1q=1italic_q = 1. By investigating kinetic helicity, we argue that the magnetic field is unlikely to organize into large-scale structures via the usual α𝛼\alphaitalic_α–effect during the post-dynamical phase. Nonetheless, even in the absence of magnetic fields, we observe intermittent polar outflows collimated by partially centrifugally evacuated polar funnels. We discuss implications for the long-term evolution in the post-dynamical inspiral phase and the ultimate emergence of the post-common-envelope binary.",12/5/2024,"['Key Words.: Hydrodynamics – binaries: close – Methods: numerical – Stars: kinematics and dynamics – Stars: winds', ' outflows – Stars: magnetic field']"
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from galaxy surveys Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from galaxy surveys,"We conducted a review of the fundamental aspects of describing and detecting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy surveys, emphasizing the optimal tools for constraining this probe based on the type of observation. Additionally, we included new results with two spectroscopic datasets to determine the best-fit model for the power spectrum, P⁢(k)𝑃𝑘P(k)italic_P ( italic_k ). Using the framework described in a previous analysis, we applied this to a different sub-sample of the BOSS survey, specifically galaxies with redshifts 0.3<z<0.6503𝑧0650.3<z<0.650.3 < italic_z < 0.65. We also examined the eBOSS dataset with redshifts 0.6<z<1.006𝑧100.6<z<1.00.6 < italic_z < 1.0, adjusting the number of parameters in the traditional polynomial fit to account for the higher redshift range.Our results showed that the dilation scale parameter α𝛼\alphaitalic_α derived from the BOSS dataset had smaller error bars compared to the eBOSS dataset, attributable to the larger number of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the BOSS sample. We also compared our findings with other surveys such as WiggleZ, DES Y6, and DESI III, noting that photometric surveys typically yield larger error bars due to their lower precision. The DESI III results were in good agreement with ours within 1⁢σ1𝜎1\sigma1 italic_σ, with most bins close to unity.The variation of α𝛼\alphaitalic_α with respect to the redshift is an unresolved issue in the field, appearing in both three-dimensional and angular tomographic analyses.",12/5/2024,"['galaxies', 'alphaitalic_α', 'spectroscopic', 'galaxy', 'photometric']"

The Red Supergiant Problem: As Seen from the Local Group’s Red Supergiant Populations,"The red supergiant (RSG) problem, which describes the apparent lack of high-luminosity progenitors detected in Type II supernova (SN) pre-images, has been a contentious topic for two decades. We re-assess this problem using a new RSG population of the Milky Way supplemented with RSGs from other galaxies in the Local Group. In particular, we quantify the uncertainties inherent to assumptions made regarding the star’s temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction. We find that only M3 or later RSGs reproduce the steepness seen from the SN II pre-imaged sample. To assess the significance of the RSG problem, we build a metallicity-weighted cumulative luminosity distribution of M3 or later RSGs and directly compare it to the luminosity distribution of SN II pre-imaged progenitors. We find no evidence of missing high-luminosity pre-imaged progenitors since the uncertainties on the pre-imaged SN progenitors and single-band derived luminosity are too large to meaningfully infer population differences.",12/5/2024,['Supernova Progenitors']
The Thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect from the Epoch of Reionization,"The thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) effect arises from inverse Compton scattering of low energyphotons onto thermal electrons, proportional to the integrated electron pressure, and is usuallyobserved from galaxy clusters. However, we can expect that the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) also contributesto this signal, but that contribution has not been previously evaluated. In this work we analyse a suiteof fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulations based on RAMSES-CUDATON to calculate and studythe tSZ signal from the Reionization Epoch. We construct lightcones of the electron pressure in theintergalactic medium for 6∼<z∼<6𝑧6\mathrel{\hbox{\hbox to0.0pt{\hbox{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\hss}\hbox{$<$}}}z6 ∼< italic_z to calculate the resulting Compton y-parameters. We vary thebox sizes, resolutions and star formation parameters to investigate how these factors affect the tSZeffect. We produce plots of maps and distributions of y𝑦yitalic_y, as well as angular temperature power spectraof the tSZ signal obtained from integrating the lightcones constructed for each simulation. We find that the tSZ signal from reionization is generally sub-dominant to the post-reionization one at larger scales (ℓ<104ℓsuperscript104\ell<10^{4}roman_ℓ < 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT), but can contribute non-trivially and potentially contaminate the measured signals. At scales probed by currentexperiments like SPT (ℓ∼103−104similar-toℓsuperscript103superscript104\ell\sim 10^{3}-10^{4}roman_ℓ ∼ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT), we find that the tSZ signal power spectrum from reionizationcontributes at roughly a percent level compared to the current templates, with the quadratic Doppler effect contributing an additional ∼10%similar-toabsentpercent10\sim 10\%∼ 10 % to the tSZ signal. At smaller scales the tSZ from reionization peaks and can potentially dominate the total signaland is thus a potentially much more important contribution to take into account in any future, more sensitive experiments.",12/5/2024,"['toℓsuperscript103superscript104', 'electrons', 'radiation', 'energyphotons', 'electron']"
Investigating the role of nuclear parametersin Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison,"Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of f−limit-from𝑓f-italic_f -mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of f−limit-from𝑓f-italic_f -modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the f−limit-from𝑓f-italic_f -mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'astrophysics', 'astrophysical', 'nuclear', 'neutron']"
DARWEN: Data-driven Algorithm for Reduction of Wide Exoplanetary Networks,"Context. Exoplanet atmospheric modeling is advancing toward complex coupled circulation-chemistry models, from chemically diverse 1D models to 3D global circulation models (GCMs). These models are crucial for interpreting observations from facilities like JWST and ELT and understanding exoplanet atmospheres. However, maintaining chemical diversity in 1D models and especially in GCMs is computationally expensive, limiting their complexity. Optimizing the number of reactions and species in the simulated atmosphere can address this tradeoff, but there is a lack of transparent and efficient methods for this optimization in the current exoplanet literature.",12/5/2024,['Key Words.: Astrochemistry –Methods: numerical –Planets and satellites: atmospheres –Planets and satellites: composition –Planets and satellites: gaseous planets']
Water Ice in the Edge-On Orion Silhouette Disk 114–426 from JWST NIRCam Images,"We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114–426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge-on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3 µmµm\micronroman_µm – compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3 µmµm\micronroman_µm dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to ∼similar-to\sim∼0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25 to 5 µmµm\micronroman_µm, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46 M⊕subscript𝑀direct-sumM_{\oplus}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paschen α𝛼\alphaitalic_α line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk.

Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time-Series for Flare Forecasting. I. Dataset Preparation,"Abstract:The accurate forecasting of solar flares is considered a key goal within the solar physics and space weather communities. There is significant potential for flare prediction to be improved by incorporating topological fluxes of magnetogram datasets, without the need to invoke three-dimensional magnetic field extrapolations. Topological quantities such as magnetic helicity and magnetic winding have shown significant potential towards this aim, and provide spatio-temporal information about the complexity of active region magnetic fields. This study develops time-series that are derived from the spatial fluxes of helicity and winding that show significant potential for solar flare prediction. It is demonstrated that time-series signals, which correlate with flare onset times, also exhibit clear spatial correlations with eruptive activity; establishing a potential causal relationship. A significant database of helicity and winding fluxes and associated time series across 144 active regions is generated using SHARP data processed with the ARTop code that forms the basis of the time-series and spatial investigations conducted here. We find that a number of time-series in this dataset often exhibit extremal signals that occur 1-8 hours before a flare. This, publicly available, living dataset will allow users to incorporate these data into their own flare prediction algorithms.",12/5/2024,"['solar', 'physics', 'magnetogram', 'flares', 'algorithms']"
The GAPS programme at TNG XLVI. A homogeneous search for Na I and its possible variability in ten gas giant exoplanets††thanks: Based on observations made with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma by the Fundación Galileo Galilei (FGG) of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.,"The neutral sodium resonance doublet (Na I D) has been detected in the upper atmosphere of several close-in gas giants, through high-resolution transmission spectroscopy.We aim to investigate whether its variability is linked to the planets’ properties, the data quality, or the accuracy of the system parameters used. Using the public code SLOPpy, we extracted the transmission spectrum in theNa I D region of ten gas giants for which a large number of HARPS-N observations are available.We modelled the absorption signals found, performing an MCMC analysis, and converted the measured absorption depth to the corresponding atmospheric height over which most sodium absorption occurs.While two targets (GJ 436 b and KELT-7 b) show no Na I D feature, we found variability in the transmission spectrum of the other targets. Three of them (HD 209458 b, WASP-80 b, and WASP-127 b) present absorption on only some nights, while in the other five targets (HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b), a significant absorption signal is present on most of the nights analysed. Except for WASP-69 b, the measured absorption depths lead to a ratio of the two Na I D depths that is compatible withor slightly larger than one.As was expected from literature, the relative atmospheric height follows an empirical exponential trend as a function of a scaled product ofthe planet’s equilibrium temperature and surface gravity.We confirm the sodium detection on HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b.The signal detected in WASP-127 b requires further observations for definitive confirmation. We exclude a planetary origin for the signals found on HD 209458 b and WASP-80 b.The sodium absorption variability does not appear to be related to planetary properties, but rather to data quality, sub-optimal data treatment, or stellar activity.",12/5/2024,"['Key Words.: planetary systems - planets and satellites: atmospheres - techniques: spectroscopic - planets and satellites: individual: GJ 436 b', ' HD 189733 b', ' HD 209458 b', ' KELT-7 b', ' KELT-9 b', ' KELT-20 b', ' WASP-69 b', ' WASP-76 b', ' WASP-80 b', ' WASP-127 b.']"
Time-Frequency Correlation of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts:Correlated Aftershocks Tend to Exhibit Downward Frequency Drifts,"The production mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains elusive,and potential correlations between burst occurrence times and variousburst properties may offer important clues. Among them, the spectralpeak frequency is particularly important because it may encode directinformation about the physical conditions and environment at theemission site. Analyzing over 4,000 bursts from the three most activesources—FRB 20121102A, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20220912A—we measure thetwo-point correlation functionξ⁢(Δ⁢t,Δ⁢νpeak)𝜉Δ𝑡Δsubscript𝜈peak\xi(\Delta t,\Delta\nu_{\rm peak})italic_ξ ( roman_Δ italic_t , roman_Δ italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_peak end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) in the two-dimensional space of timeseparationΔ⁢tΔ𝑡\Delta troman_Δ italic_t and peak frequency shift Δ⁢νpeakΔsubscript𝜈peak\Delta\nu_{\rm peak}roman_Δ italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_peak end_POSTSUBSCRIPT between burst pairs.

Investigating Kozai-Lidov Oscillations and Disc Tearing in Be Star Discs,"Recent simulations of Be stars in misaligned binary systems have revealed that misalignment between the disc and binary orbit can cause the disc to undergo Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations or disc-tearing. We build on our previous suite of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of equal-mass systems by simulating eight new misaligned Be star binary systems, with mass-ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, or equal-mass systems with varying viscosity. We find the same phenomena occur as previously for mass ratios of 0.5, while the mass ratio of 0.1 does not cause KL oscillations or disc-tearing for the parameters examined. With increased viscosity in our equal-mass simulations, we show that these phenomena and other oscillations are damped out and do not occur. We also briefly compare two viscosity prescriptions and find they can produce the same qualitative disc evolution. Next, we use the radiative transfer code hdust to predict observable trends of a KL oscillation, and show how the observables oscillate in sync with disc inclination and cause large changes in the polarization position angle. Our models generate highly complex line profiles, including triple-peak profiles that are known to occur in Be stars. The mapping between the SPH simulations and these triple-peak features gives us hints as to where they originate. Finally, we construct interferometric predictions of how a gap in the disc, produced by KL oscillations or disc-tearing, perturbs the visibility versus baseline curve at multiple wavelengths, and can cause large changes to the differential phase profile across an emission line.",12/5/2024,"['interferometric', 'stars', 'misalignment', 'oscillation', 'evolution']"
The radio properties of the JWST-discovered AGN,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. A large fraction of these AGN revealed a significant lack of X-ray emission, with observed X-ray luminosity upper limits 2-3 dex lower than expected.We explore the radio emission of these AGN, focusing on the JWST-selected Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected, spectroscopically confirmed BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144 MHz, 1.5 GHz, 3 GHz, 5.5 GHz, 10 GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies.Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ∼0.2⁢μsimilar-toabsent0.2𝜇\sim 0.2\mu∼ 0.2 italic_μJy beam-1, corresponding to a 3⁢σ3𝜎3\sigma3 italic_σ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of L5⁢G⁢H⁢z=2×1039subscript𝐿5𝐺𝐻𝑧2superscript1039L_{5GHz}=2\times 10^{39}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 italic_G italic_H italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 39 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg s-1 at the mean redshift of the sample z∼5.2similar-to𝑧5.2z\sim 5.2italic_z ∼ 5.2. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies.We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that ∼similar-to\sim∼1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.",12/5/2024,"['Key Words.:  Galaxies: active', ' Galaxies: high-redshift', ' Radio continuum: galaxies']"
Ionospheric conductances at the giant planets of the Solar System:a comparative study of ionization sources and the impact of meteoric ions,"The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complex interplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind, and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, the Hall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate the intensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and the rate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents.We perform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and conductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studied ions to H+3superscriptsubscriptabsent3{}_{3}^{+}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, CH+5superscriptsubscriptabsent5{}_{5}^{+}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 5 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductances on the structure and composition of these planets’ upper atmospheres and on the main ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitating electrons, and meteoroid ablation).After checking that our model reproduces the conclusions of Nakamura \BOthers. (\APACyear2022) at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integrated conductances is non-negligible,we show that this contribution could also be non-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionization processes caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV (typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magnetic field, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer where meteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",12/5/2024,"['magnetospheres', 'magnetosphere', 'jupiter', 'ionosphere', 'ionospheric']"

BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey. I. Survey Design and Initial Results,"Abstract:We introduce the Bias-free Extragalactic Analysis for Cosmic Origins with NIRCam (BEACON) survey, a JWST Cycle2 program allocated up to 600 pure-parallel hours of observations. BEACON explores high-latitude areas of the sky with JWST/NIRCam over $\sim100$ independent sightlines, totaling $\sim0.3$deg$^2$, reaching a median F444W depth of $\approx28.2$AB mag (5$\sigma$). Based on existing JWST observations in legacy fields, we estimate that BEACON will photometrically identify 25--150 galaxies at $z>10$ and 500--1000 at $z\sim7$--10 uniquely enabled by an efficient multiple filter configuration spanning $0.9$--5.0$\mu$m. The expected sample size of $z>10$ galaxies will allow us to obtain robust number density estimates and to discriminate between different models of early star formation. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey design and initial results using the first 19 fields. We present 129 galaxy candidates at $z>7$ identified in those fields, including 11 galaxies at $z>10$ and several UV-luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-21$mag) galaxies at $z\sim8$. The number densities of $z<13$ galaxies inferred from the initial fields are overall consistent with those in the literature. Despite reaching a considerably large volume ($\sim10^5$Mpc$^3$), however, we find no galaxy candidates at $z>13$, providing us with a complimentary insight into early galaxy evolution with minimal cosmic variance. We publish imaging and catalog data products for these initial fields. Upon survey completion, all BEACON data will be coherently processed and distributed to the community along with catalogs for redshift and other physical quantities.",12/5/2024,"['cosmic', 'f444w', 'hours', 'galaxies', 'extragalactic']"
Deep imaging of three accelerating stars using SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam at LBT,"The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT’s high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L’-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should residebetween 3 and  30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.",12/5/2024,"['stars', 'astronomical', 'star', 'stellar', 'imaging']"

However, the cosmological constant ΛΛ\Lambdaroman_Λ, necessary to close the model to critical density, remains an open conundrum. We explore the observed late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, where we consider that the Friedmann equation describes the expansion history of FLRW universes in the local reference frame of freely falling comoving observers, which perceive flat, homogeneous and isotropic space in their local inertial system, where, as a consequence of the equivalence principle, special relativity applies. We use this fact to propose an extension to ΛΛ\Lambdaroman_ΛCDM, incorporating the initial conditions of the background universe, comprising the initial energy densities as well as the initial post big bang expansion rate. The observed late-time accelerated expansion is then attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energy component.

Insights on the Rotational State and Shape of Asteroid (203) Pompeja from TESS Photometry,"The Main Belt asteroid (203) Pompeja shows evidence of extreme variability in visible and near-infrared spectral slope with time. The observed spectral variability has been hypothesized to be attributed to spatial variations across Pompeja’s surface. In this scenario, the observed spectrum of Pompeja is dependent on the geometry of the Sun and the observer relative to the asteroid’s spin pole and surface features. Knowledge of the rotational spin pole and shape can be gleaned from light curves and photometric measurements. However, dense light curves of Pompeja are only available from two apparitions. Further, previous estimates of Pompeja’s sidereal period are close to being Earth-commensurate, making ground-based light curves difficult to obtain. To overcome these difficulties, we implement a pipeline to extract a dense light curve of Pompeja from cutouts of TESS Full Frame Images. We succeeded in obtaining a dense light curve of Pompeja covering ∼similar-to\sim∼22 complete rotations.

The cosmic globular cluster formation history in the E-MOSAICS simulations,"We present a comprehensive analysis of globular cluster (GC) formation and evolution across the 343superscript34334^{3}34 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT Mpc3 volume of the E-MOSAICS galaxy formation simulations.

The redshift of peak GC formation rate increases weakly with galaxy mass, decreases with metallicity, and does not differ between centrals and satellites. The epoch of peak GC formation precedes that of the stars by a factor of 1.1−1.61.11.61.1{-}1.61.1 - 1.6, primarily due to ‘downsizing’, i.e. low-mass galaxies form their stars later. Consequently, this offset decreases with galaxy mass, leading to nearly coeval stellar and GC populations in massive galaxies (>1011⁢M⊙absentsuperscript1011subscriptMdirect-product>10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}> 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT). GCs themselves do not exhibit strong downsizing, because they predominantly formed at early cosmic epochs conducive to the formation (through high gas pressures) and survival (through high galaxy merger and GC migration rates) of massive, compact stellar systems.

Three-dimensional velocity fields in the silicon- and sulfur-reach ejecta in the remnant of Tycho supernova,"Abstract:The three-dimensional velocity structure of the shock-heated Si-reach and S-reach ejecta were reconstructed in Tycho supernova remnant from Doppler-shifted lines. The vector components along the line of sight were restored from the spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Doppler shifts of Si XIII and S XV lines. The components in the plane of the sky were derived from analysis of the proper motion of the remnant's edge at different azimuths. This has been done by using the data of X-ray observations from Chandra observatory as well as the radio data from the Very Large Array.Differences in Doppler velocities over the Tycho's SNR are of the order of thousands of km/s. The speed of the ejecta on the opposite sides of the remnant as a three-dimensional object differs on 20-30%. There are asymmetries and differences in the spatial distributions between the Si-reach and S-reach ejecta components. Namely, the level of isotropy is higher in Si while the vector components directed outward of the observer are larger in S. This puts limitations on the level of deviation of the internal structure of the progenitor star from the ideal layered structure as well as on the level of asymmetries in supernova explosion.",12/5/2024,"['supernova', 'explosion', 'spectral', 'star', 'observatory']"
A Spectrophotometric analysis and dust properties of classical nova V5584 Sgr,"In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data.Light curve analysis shows t2 and t3 values of ∼similar-to\sim∼ 26 and ∼similar-to\sim∼ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast.The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY.

Radio pulsar population synthesis with consistent flux measurements using simulation-based inference,"The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4%percent44\%4 % of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars’ intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars’ radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.",12/5/2024,['Key Words.: Methods: data analysis – Methods: statistical – Stars: neutron – (Stars:) pulsars: general']

The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light,"GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting ∼65similar-toabsent65\sim 65∼ 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z𝑧zitalic_z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment.By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light.We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g′⁢r′⁢i′⁢z′⁢J⁢H⁢Kssuperscript𝑔′superscript𝑟′superscript𝑖′superscript𝑧′𝐽𝐻subscript𝐾𝑠g^{\prime}r^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}JHK_{s}italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_J italic_H italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst.

Restoring Missing Modes of 21cm Intensity Mapping with Deep Learning: Impact on BAO Reconstruction,"In 21cm intensity mapping of the large-scale structure (LSS), regions in Fourier space could be compromised by foreground contamination. In interferometric observations, this contamination, known as the foreground wedge, is exacerbated by the chromatic response of antennas, leading to substantial data loss. Meanwhile, the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction, which operates in configuration space to ""linearize"" the BAO signature, offers improved constraints on the sound horizon scale. However, missing modes within these contaminated regions can negatively impact the BAO reconstruction algorithm.To address this challenge, we employ the deep learning model U-Net to recover the lost modes before applying the BAO reconstruction algorithm. Despite hardware limitations, such as GPU memory, our results demonstrate that the AI-restored 21cm temperature map achieves a high correlation with the original signal, with a correlation ratio of approximately 0.90.90.90.9 at k∼1⁢h/Mpcsimilar-to𝑘1hMpck\sim 1{\rm h/Mpc}italic_k ∼ 1 roman_h / roman_Mpc. Furthermore, subsequent BAO reconstruction indicates that the AI restoration has minimal impact on the performance of the ‘linearized’ BAO signal, proving the effectiveness of the machine learning approach to mitigate the impact of foreground contamination. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the AI model trained on coarser fields can be effectively applied to finer fields, achieving even higher correlation. This success is likely attributable to the scale-invariance properties of non-linear mode coupling in large-scale structure and the hierarchical structure of the U-Net architecture.",12/5/2024,"['exacerbated', 'contaminated', 'contamination', 'reconstruction', 'compromised']"

Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution,"I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.",12/5/2024,"['stars: jets – stars: AGB and post-AGB – binaries: close – stars: winds', ' outflows – planetary nebulae: general']"

We estimated the average difference <D_NAM - D_TRGB> = -0.30 +- 0.08 Mpc and the standard deviation of 1.57 Mpc. Approximately the same difference in the distance scale is obtained in comparison with less accurate distance estimates through the membership of galaxies in known groups or from the Tully-Fisher relation. We conclude that the NAM method provides distance estimates with an accuracy of 20% within the Local Volume, which is valid for ~90% of the sky, except for the regions of the Virgo cluster and the Coma-I group.",12/5/2024,"['galaxies', '418', 'telescope', 'cosmic', 'space']"
First Measurements of the 4-Point Correlation Function of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence as a Novel Probe of the Interstellar Medium,"In the Interstellar Medium (ISM), gas and dust evolve under magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This produces dense, non-linear structures that then seed star formation. Observationally and theoretically, turbulence is quantified by summary statistics such as the 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or its Fourier-space analog the power spectrum. These cannot capture the non-Gaussian correlations coming from turbulence’s highly non-linear nature. We here for the first time apply the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) to turbulence, measuring it on a large suite of MHD simulations that mirror, as well as currently possible, the conditions expected in the ISM. The 4PCF captures the dependence of correlations between quadruplets of density points on the geometry of the tetrahedron they form. Using a novel functionality added to the sarabande code specifically for this work, we isolate the purely non-Gaussian piece of the 4PCF. We then explore simulations with a range of pressures, P𝑃Pitalic_P, and magnetic fields, B𝐵Bitalic_B (but without self-gravity); these are quantified by different sonic (MS)subscript𝑀S(M_{\rm S})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and Alfvénic (MA)subscript𝑀A(M_{\rm A})( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) Mach numbers. We show that the 4PCF has rich behavior that can in future be used as a diagnostic of ISM conditions. We also show that a large-scale coherent magnetic field leads to parity-odd modes of the 4PCF, a clean test of magnetic field coherence with observational ramifications. All our measurements of the 4PCF (10 MS,MAsubscript𝑀Ssubscript𝑀AM_{\rm S},M_{\rm A}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT combinations, 9 time-slices for each, 34 4PCF modes for each) are made public for the community to explore.",12/5/2024,"['magnetohydrodynamic', 'interstellar', 'turbulence', 'space', 'magnetic']"
CO-to-H2 conversion factor and grain size distribution through the analysis of αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT–qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT relation,"The CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) is expected to vary with dust abundance and grain size distribution through the efficiency of shielding gas from CO-dissociation radiation.We present a comprehensive analysis of αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and grain size distribution for nearby galaxies, using the PAH fraction (qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) as an observable proxy of grain size distribution.We adopt the resolved observations at 2 kpc resolution in 42 nearby galaxies, where αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is derived from measured metallicity and surface densities of dust and H i assuming a fixed dust-to-metals ratio. We use an analytical model for the evolution of H2 and CO, in which the evolution of grain size distribution is controlled by the dense gas fraction (η𝜂\etaitalic_η).We find that the observed level of qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is consistent with the diffuse-gas-dominated model (η=0.2𝜂0.2\eta=0.2italic_η = 0.2) where dust shattering is more efficient. Meanwhile, the slight decreasing trend of observed qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with metallicity is more consistent with high-η𝜂\etaitalic_η predictions, likely due to the more efficient loss of PAHs by coagulation.We discuss how grain size distribution (indicated by qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and metallicity impact αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT; we however did not obtain conclusive evidence that the grain size distribution affects αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Observations and model predictions show similar anti-correlation between αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 12+log(O/H).Meanwhile, there is a considerable difference in how resolved αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT behaves with qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. The observed αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT has a positive correlation with qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, while the model-predicted αCOsubscript𝛼CO\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}italic_α start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT does not have a definite correlation with qPAHsubscript𝑞PAHq_{\mathrm{PAH}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PAH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

Measuring our peculiar velocity from spectroscopic redshift surveys,"Our peculiar velocityimprints a dipoleon galaxy density maps derived from redshift surveys.The dipole gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the multipole momentsof the observed power spectrum which we indicate as the finger-of-the-observer (FOTO) effect.

Predictions of Dust Continuum Emission from a Potential Circumplanetary Disk: A Case Study of the Planet Candidate AB Aurigae b,"Gas accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks are expected to show dust thermal emission from their circumplanetary disks (CPDs). However, a recently reported gas accreting planet candidate, AB Aurigae b, has not been detected in (sub)millimeter continuum observations. We calculate the evolution of dust in the potential CPD of AB Aurigae b and predict its thermal emission at 1.3 mm wavelength as a case study, where the obtained features may also be applied to other gas accreting planets. We find that the expected flux density from the CPD is lower than the 3⁢σ3𝜎3\sigma3 italic_σ level of the previous continuum observation by ALMA with broad ranges of parameters, consistent with the non-detection. However, the expected planet mass and gas accretion rate are higher if the reduction of the observed near-infrared continuum and Hα𝛼\alphaitalic_α line emission due to the extinction by small grains is considered, resulting in higher flux density of the dust emission from the CPD at (sub)millimeter wavelength. We find that the corrected predictions of the dust emission are stronger than the 3⁢σ3𝜎3\sigma3 italic_σ level of the previous observation with the typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of the inflow to the CPD. This result suggests that the dust supply to the vicinity of AB Aurigae b is small if the planet candidate is not the scattered light of the star but is a planet and has a CPD. Future continuum observations at shorter wavelength are preferable to obtain more robust clues to the question whether the candidate is a planet or not.",12/5/2024,['Millimeter astronomy (1061) — Planet formation (1241) — Protoplanetary disks (1300) — Exoplanet astronomy (486) — Dust continuum emission (412)']
Observational Properties of 155 β𝛽\betaitalic_β Cephei pulsating variable stars,"β𝛽\betaitalic_β Cephei pulsating variable (BCEP) stars are the most massive pulsating variable stars in the main sequence, exhibiting both p- and g-mode pulsations.In this study, we identified 155 BCEP stars or candidates using data from TESS and Gaia, of which 83 were first confirmed as BCEP stars. They have visual magnitudes ranging from 8 to 12 mag and effective temperatures between approximately 20,000 and 30,000 K, while the parallaxes of most targets are between 0.2 and 0.6 mas. The study indicates that these BCEP stars have pulsation periods ranging from 0.06 to 0.31 days, with amplitudes ranging from 0.1 to 55.8 mmag in the TESS band. Additionally, the number of BCEP stars increases as the pulsation amplitude decreases. These targets align with the distribution region of BCEP stars in the luminosity-period (L-P) and temperature-period (T-P) diagrams. We have updated the L-P relation of BCEP stars. The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram indicates that these targets are in the main-sequence evolutionary phase, with masses ranging from 7 to 20 M⊙subscript𝑀direct-productM_{\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and luminosities between 2800 and 71,000 L⊙subscript𝐿direct-productL_{\odot}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. They are almost in the theoretical instability region of BCEP stars but as previously reported, this region at the low-mass end (red) is not filled. The distribution of the pulsation constant indicates that the dominant pulsation periods of BCEP stars consist mainly of low-order p-mode pulsations with a high proportion of radial fundamental modes. These BCEP stars are excellent objects for enhancing our understanding of the structure and evolution of massive stars through asteroseismology.",12/5/2024,['stars: massive -stars: pulsating']
Search for transient gamma-ray emission from magnetar flares using Fermi-LAT,"We search for transient gamma-ray emission in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV using data from the Fermi-LAT telescope in coincidence with magnetar flares.For our analysis we look for coincidence with 15 distinct flares from 11 magnetars using two distinct time windows of ±plus-or-minus\pm± 1 day and ±plus-or-minus\pm± 15 days.For 14 of these flares from 10 magnetars, we do not see any statistically significant gamma-ray emission.However, we see two gamma-ray flares from one magnetar, namely 1E 1048.1-5937, with combined significance of 5⁢σ5𝜎5\sigma5 italic_σ, observed after about 10 days from the peak of the X-ray flare.However, this magnetar is located close to the galactic plane (with galactic latitude of -0.52°) and this signal could be caused by contamination due to diffuse flux from gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.",12/5/2024,"['fermi', 'telescope', 'galactic', 'flares', 'sigma5']"
Isolated neutron stars as Science Validation for XMM2ATHENA††thanks: XMM2ATHENA is a program funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.: Ensuring robust data for future X-ray Astronomy,"The discovery of radio-quiet, X-ray thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (XINSs) in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey revealed a previously overlooked component of the neutron star population. Advancements in X-ray instrumentation and the availability of deep, wide-area optical surveys now enable us to explore XINSs at fainter X-ray fluxes and greater distances. In this study, we investigated candidates selected from the 4XMM-DR9 catalogue using XMM-Newton, focusing on long-term flux stability, spectral characterisation, and astrometry. By leveraging resources from the XMM2ATHENA project – including updated catalogues, multiwavelength characterisation and machine learning classification – we refined our understanding of this sample of soft X-ray emitters.

A catalog of new slowly pulsating B-type stars,"This paper reports the discovery of new slowly pulsating B-type stars. Based on the photometric, spectral, and astrometric data of TESS, LAMOST, and Gaia surveys, we have found 286 new slowly pulsating B-type stars (SPB stars) and 21 candidates. Among these, 20 are Be stars or candidates with emission line profiles. It is shown that these SPB stars have luminosities between 40 and 2850 L⊙subscript𝐿direct-productL_{\odot}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and effective temperatures ranging from 10000K to 21000K. Their pulsation periods are from 0.14 to 6.5 days with amplitude ranges of 0.2-20 mmag in TESS band. It is indicated that these targets follow the distribution of the SPB stars in the period-luminosity (P-L) and the period-temperature (P-T) diagrams.

However, there are some targets beyond the red edge of the theoretical instability region, which should be caused by the rapid rotation reducing the measured effective temperature.

Among the 155 objects, 87 samples are identified as SPB stars including 37 objects with pure low-frequency and 50 objects with both low- and high-frequency pulsation, and 14 samples are identified as BCEP stars with both low- and high-frequency pulsation.

Photospheric Swirls in a Quiet-Sun Region,"Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA), we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe I 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun’s central meridian by the Swedish 1111-m Solar Telescope. Via a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of ∼similar-to\sim∼300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of ∼similar-to\sim∼5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction and vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. All these results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56.5′′×57.5′′superscript56.5′′superscript57.5′′56.5^{\prime\prime}\times 57.5^{\prime\prime}56.5 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT × 57.5 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT field-of-view (FOV) could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales.

A Galactic Scale Magnetized Wind Around a Normal Star-Forming Galaxy,"Galaxy formation theory identifies superwinds as a key regulator of star formation rates, galaxy growth, and chemical enrichment. Thermal and radiation pressure are known to drive galactic-scale winds in dusty starbursting galaxies (e.g. M82), but modern numerical simulations have recently highlighted that cosmic-ray (CR) driven winds may be especially important in normal galaxies with modest star formation rate surface densities. However, CR-driven winds have yet to be conclusively observed—leaving significant uncertainty in their detailed microphysics.

Galaxy Morphology in CANDELS: Addressing Evolutionary Changes Across 0.2≤z≤2.40.2𝑧2.40.2\leq z\leq 2.40.2 ≤ italic_z ≤ 2.4 with Hybrid Classification Approach,"Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift.

Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z>1𝑧1z>1italic_z > 1 and a consistent ∼25%similar-toabsentpercent25\sim 25\%∼ 25 % disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18% of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (∼60%similar-toabsentpercent60\sim 60\%∼ 60 %) and spheroids (∼30%similar-toabsentpercent30\sim 30\%∼ 30 %) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z=1𝑧1z=1italic_z = 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data.

MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics,"Multiphase gas, with hot (∼106similar-toabsentsuperscript106\sim 10^{6}∼ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPTK) and cold (∼104similar-toabsentsuperscript104\sim 10^{4}∼ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPTK) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce a new subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approach based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth.As part of the model, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulent velocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the local velocity gradients.We verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and without cold gas growth.We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement across the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both local turbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property.We discuss the applications and possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation.",12/4/2024,"['hot', 'astrophysical', 'extensive', 'large', 'turbulent']"
Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in eagle: lifetimes and longevity of misaligned galaxies,"The dominant processes by which galaxies replenish their cold gas reservoirs remain disputed, especially in massive galaxies. Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments offer an opportunity to study these replenishment processes.

Mergers only cause ∼17%similar-toabsentpercent17\sim 17\%∼ 17 % of unstable misalignments in eagle. We conclude that, at least in eagle, unstable kinematic misalignments are not predominantly driven by gas-rich minor mergers.

We present results on the correlation between the 2175Å feature and PAH abundances in a spatially-resolved manner for 15 local galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST survey that have NUV and mid-IR imaging data from Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI, respectively. We find a moderate positive correlation between the 2175Å feature strength and PAH abundance (spearman coefficient, 0.3≲ρ≲0.5less-than-or-similar-to0.3𝜌less-than-or-similar-to0.50.3\lesssim\rho\lesssim 0.50.3 ≲ italic_ρ ≲ 0.5), albeit with large intrinsic scatter. However, most of this trend can be attributed to a stronger negative correlation of both quantities with SFR surface density and specific-SFR (proxies of ionising radiation; ρ∼−0.6similar-to𝜌0.6\rho\sim-0.6italic_ρ ∼ - 0.6).The latter trends are consistent with previous findings that both the 2175Å carrier and PAHs are small grains that are easily destroyed by UV photons,although the proxy for PAH abundance (based on photometry) could also be influenced by dust heating.When controlling for SFR surface density, we find weaker correlations between the 2175Å feature and PAH abundances (ρ≲0.3less-than-or-similar-to𝜌0.3\rho\lesssim 0.3italic_ρ ≲ 0.3), disfavouring a direct link. However, analyses based on spectroscopic (instead of photometric) measurements of the 2175Å feature and PAH features are required to verify our findings.No significant trends with gas-phase metallicity or galactocentric radii are found for the 2175Å feature and PAHs, however the metallicity range of our sample is limited (8.40<12+log⁡[O/H]<8.658.4012OH8.658.40<12+\log[\mathrm{O/H}]<8.658.40 < 12 + roman_log [ roman_O / roman_H ] < 8.65). We provide prescriptions for the strength of the 2175Å feature and PAHs in local massive (metal-rich) galaxies with SFR surface density and specific-SFR, however the former should be used with caution due to the fact that bump strengths measured from Swift/UVOT are expected to be underestimated.",12/4/2024,"['photometry', 'spectroscopic', 'radiation', 'photometric', 'galaxies']"
A nuclear spiral in a dusty star-forming galaxy at z=2.78𝑧2.78z=2.78italic_z = 2.78,"The nuclear structure of dusty star-forming galaxies is largely unexplored but harbours critical information about their structural evolution. Here, we present long-baseline Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) continuum observations of a gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxy at z=2.78𝑧2.78z=2.78italic_z = 2.78. We use a pixellated lens modelling analysis to reconstruct the rest-frame 230 μμ\upmuroman_μm dust emission with a mean resolution of ≈55absent55\approx 55≈ 55 pc and demonstrate that the inferred source properties are robust to changes in lens modelling methodology. The central 1 kpc is characterised by an exponential profile, a dual spiral arm morphology and an apparent super-Eddington compact central starburst. We find tentative evidence for a nuclear bar in the central 300 pc. These features may indicate that secular dynamical processes play a role in accumulating a high concentration of cold gas that fuels the rapid formation of a compact stellar spheroid and black hole accretion. We propose that the high spatial resolution provided by long-baseline ALMA observations and strong gravitational lensing will give key insights into the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies.",12/4/2024,['Key Words.: Galaxies: high-redshift – Galaxies: structure – Submillimeter: galaxies – Gravitational lensing: strong']

Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars: A Correlation with Effective Temperature and Implications for White Dwarf Merger Outcomes,"Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses – dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of 18O in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied.We present high-resolution (R≈75000𝑅75000R\approx 75000italic_R ≈ 75000) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure 16O/18O ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have 16O/18O <1absent1<1< 1, while the RCB stars have 16O/18O >4absent4>4> 4. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing 16O/18O ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models.However, we note that current models overpredict the low 16O/18O ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude.We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars.We observe a correlation between the abundances of 14N and 18O in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the 14N is converted to 18O in these stars via α𝛼\alphaitalic_α-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.",12/4/2024,"['supergiants', '75000italic_r', 'spectroscopically', 'anomalous', 'stars']"
Exploring velocity dispersion anisotropy in a dark matter dominated ultra-diffuse galaxy with modified gravity models,"The kinematics of the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF44 is primarily influenced by the presence of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we conduct a contrasting kinematic study of DF44 within the alternative modified gravity framework. In comparison to NFW DM, we test three alternative gravity models viz Milgromian dynamics (MOND), characterized by a known acceleration scale,a generic f⁢(R)𝑓𝑅f(R)italic_f ( italic_R ) model, assuming an expansion of the Ricci scalar, and a quantum gravity-inspired Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR), which involves the running of the gravitational coupling parameter G𝐺Gitalic_G with the Universe’s energy scale. For each gravity model, we evaluate the velocity dispersion (VD) of the galaxy beyond the conventional radial isotropic assumption and extend to two anisotropy scenarios, i.e., constant and Osipkov-Merritt. Our results show that all three gravity models can provide consistent fits to the observed VD of DF44; however, only MOND and RGGR remain competitive with NFW DM. Interestingly, the constant anisotropy scenario in all the models is also found to be competitive with the complete isotropic assumption.",12/4/2024,"['ngc1052', 'quantum', 'df44', 'galaxy', 'kinematics']"
Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)with broad-line emission in the early universe.Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidenceof AGN activity – such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability – remains rarely detected.The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processesor environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts.In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae.Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formedthrough effective inverse Comptonization.This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistentwith those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs.In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weakyet exhibit significant relative variability.These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with ≲107−8⁢M⊙less-than-or-similar-toabsentsuperscript1078subscript𝑀direct-product\lesssim 10^{7-8}~{}M_{\odot}≲ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 - 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, which undergorapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.",12/4/2024,"['radiation', 'galactic', 'telescope', 'photon', 'space']"
"Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions","The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a “magnifying glass”, where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of 6⁢M⊙6subscript𝑀direct-product6M_{\odot}6 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the “mirror principle” induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a 9⁢M⊙9subscript𝑀direct-product9M_{\odot}9 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a 12⁢M⊙12subscript𝑀direct-product12M_{\odot}12 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.",12/4/2024,"['blue', 'photon', 'stars', 'magnifying', 'stellar']"
A Unified Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation and Radio Extreme Scattering Events from Intermittent Interstellar Structures,"Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale (∼similar-to\sim∼AU) as the gyroradii of ∼similar-to\sim∼GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).",12/4/2024,['Cosmic rays — Interstellar magnetic fields — Interstellar medium — Interstellar scattering — Radio continuum emission']
Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect,"In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, z≈0.3𝑧0.3z\approx 0.3italic_z ≈ 0.3, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ detection in the quadrupole (m=2𝑚2m=2italic_m = 2), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the “missing baryons.” Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.",12/4/2024,"['cosmology', 'spectroscopic', 'galaxy', 'telescope', '3italic_z']"
Galaxy Formation in the Early Universe,"Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the presence of bright and well-formed galaxies at high redshifts, challenging the predictions of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model.

SpyDust: an improved and extended implementation for modeling spinning dust radiation,"This paper presents SpyDust, an improved and extended implementation of the spinning dust emission model based on a Fokker-Planck treatment. SpyDust serves not only as a Python successor to spdust, but also incorporates some corrections and extensions. Unlike spdust, which is focused on specific grain shapes, SpyDust considers a wider range of grain shapes and provides the corresponding grain dynamics, directional radiation field and angular momentum transports. We recognise the unique effects of different grain shapes on emission, in particular the shape-dependent mapping between rotational frequency and spectral frequency.In addition, we update the expressions for effects of electrical dipole radiation back-reaction and plasma drag on angular momentum dissipation.We also discuss the degeneracies in describing the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of spinning dust grains with the interstellar environmental parameters. Using a typical Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) environment as an example, we perform a perturbative analysis of the model parameters, revealing strong positive or negative correlations between them. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows that four dominant modes can linearly capture most of the SED variations, highlighting the degeneracy in the parameter space of the SED shape in the vicinity of the chosen CNM environment. This opens the possibility for future applications of moment expansion methods to reduce the dimensionality of the encountered SED parameter space.",12/4/2024,"['spydust', 'python', 'interstellar', 'radiation', 'extensions']"
The Outskirt Stellar Mass of Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies is an Excellent Halo Mass Proxy in Illustris/IllustrisTNG Simulations,"Abstract:Recent observations suggest that the extended stellar halos of low-redshift massive galaxies are tightly connected to the assembly of their dark matter halos. In this paper, we use the Illustris, IllustrisTNG100, and IllustrisTNG300 simulations to compare how different stellar aperture masses trace halo mass. For massive central galaxies ($M_\star\geq 10^{11.2}M_\odot$), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 to 100 kpc ($M_{\star,[50,100]}$) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that $M_{\star,[50,100]}$ correlates better with halo mass than the total amount of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes are different between Illustris and IllustrisTNG100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (about 70% in $M_{\star,[50,100]}$). These results demonstrate the potential of using the outskirt stellar mass to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection in massive dark matter halos and trace dark matter halos better.",12/4/2024,"['galaxies', 'illustristng100', 'galaxy', 'stars', 'illustristng300']"
First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate Mass Black Hole in POX 52:Deep Multi-Band Observations with ATCA and VLA,"We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2–4 GHz) and C band (4–8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.",12/4/2024,['Intermediate-mass black holes (816); Radio continuum emission (1340); Seyfert galaxies (1447); Dwarf galaxies (416)']
Low-Frequency Turnover Star Forming Galaxies I: Radio Continuum Observations and Global Properties,"There is growing evidence that the broad-band radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) contain a wealth of complex physics. In this paper we aim to determine the physical emission and loss processes causing radio SED curvature and steepening to see what observed global astrophysical properties, if any, are correlated with radio SED complexity. To do this we have acquired radio continuum data between 70 MHz and 17 GHz for a sample of 19 southern local (z<0.04𝑧0.04z<0.04italic_z < 0.04) SFGs. Of this sample 11 are selected to contain low-frequency (¡ 300 MHz) turnovers (LFTOs) in their SEDs and eight are control galaxies with similar global properties. We model the radio SEDs for our sample using a Bayesian framework whereby radio emission (synchrotron and free-free) and absorption or loss processes are included modularly. We find that without the inclusion of higher frequency data (¿ 17 GHz) single synchrotron power-law based models are always preferred for our sample; however, additional processes including free-free absorption (FFA) and synchrotron losses are often required to accurately model radio SED complexity in SFGs. The fitted synchrotron spectral indices range from -0.45 to -1.07 and are strongly anticorrelated with stellar mass suggesting that synchrotron losses are the dominant mechanism acting to steepen the spectral index in larger/more massive nearby SFGs. We find that LFTOs in the radio SED are independent from the inclination of SFGs, however higher inclination galaxies tend to have steeper fitted spectral indices indicating losses to diffusion of cosmic ray electrons into the galactic halo. Four of five of the merging systems in our SFG sample have elevated specific star formation rates and flatter fitted spectral indices with unconstrained LFTOs. Lastly, we find no significant separation in global properties between SFGs with or without modelled LFTOs. Overall these results suggest that LFTOs are likely caused by a combination of FFA and ionisation losses in individual recent starburst regions with specific orientations and interstellar medium properties that, when averaged over the entire galaxy, do not correlate with global astrophysical properties.",12/4/2024,"['astrophysical', 'starburst', 'physics', 'galaxies', 'interstellar']"
Galaxy mass dependence of metal-enrichment of nuclear star clusters,"Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) are commonly found in galaxy centers, but their dominant formation mechanisms remain elusive. We perform a consistent analysis of stellar populations of 97 nearby NSCs, based on VLT spectroscopic data. The sample covers a galaxy stellar mass range of 107 to 1011 M⊙ and is more than 3×\times× larger than any previous studies.

In the low-mass regime of log⁡Mhostsubscript𝑀host\log M_{\rm host}roman_log italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_host end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≲less-than-or-similar-to\lesssim≲ 8.5, nearly all NSCs have metallicities lower than circum-NSC host but similar to typical red globular clusters (GCs), supporting the GC inspiral-merger scenario of NSC formation.

In the intermediate-mass regime, a comparable fraction of NSCs have higher or lower metallicities than circum-NSC host and red GCs, with no clear dependence on NSC mass, suggesting intermittent in-situ SF. The majority of NSCs with higher metallicities than their host exhibit a negative age−--metallicity correlation, providing clear evidence of long-term chemical enrichment.

Formation of Transitional cE/UCD Galaxies through Massive/Dwarf Disc Galaxy Mergers,"The dynamics of the merger of a dwarf disc galaxy with a massive spiral galaxy of the Milky Way type have been studied in detail. The remnant of such interaction after numerous crossings of the satellite through the disc of the main galaxy is a compact stellar core, the characteristics of which are close to small compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) or large ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs). Such transitional cE/UCD objects with an effective radius of 100-200 pc arise as a result of stripping the outer layers of the stellar core during the destruction of a disc dwarf galaxy. Numerical models of the satellite before interaction include baryonic matter (stars and gas) and dark mass.We use N-body to describe the dynamics of stars and dark matter and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics to model the gas components of both galaxies. The direct method of calculating the gravitational force between all particles provides a qualitative resolution of spatial structures up to 10 pc.The dwarf galaxy falls onto the gas and stellar discs of the main galaxy almost along a radial trajectory with a large eccentricity. This ensures that the dwarf crosses the disc of the main galaxy at each pericentric approach over a time interval of more than 9 billion years. We vary the gas mass and the initial orbital characteristics of the satellite over a wide range, studying the features of mass loss in the core. The presence of the initial gas component in a dwarf galaxy significantly affects the nature of the formation and evolution of the compact stellar core. Gas-rich satellite gives birth to a more compact elliptical galaxy compared to the merging gas-free dwarf galaxy.The initial gas content in the satellite also affects the internal rotation in the stripped nucleus.The simulated cE/UCD galaxies contain very little gas and dark matter at the end of their evolution.",12/4/2024,"['galaxies', 'galaxy', 'dwarfs', 'gravitational', 'stars']"
Solar System Migration Points to a Renewed Concept: Galactic Habitable Orbits,"Astrophysical evidence suggests that the Sun was born near 5 kpc from the Galactic center, within the corotation radius of the Galactic bar, around 6–7 kpc. This presents challenges for outward migration due to the Jacobi energy constraint, preventing stars from easily overcoming the corotation barrier. In this study, we use test particle simulations to explore two possible migration pathways for the Sun: a “trapped” scenario, where the Sun’s orbit was influenced by a slowing Galactic bar, and an “untrapped” scenario driven by dynamic spiral arms. Our results demonstrate that both mechanisms can explain how the Sun migrated from its birth radius (≈5absent5\approx 5≈ 5 kpc) to its current orbital radius around 8.5–9 kpc. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Sun along these migration pathways, focusing on variations in radiation hazards and comet fluxes, which may have impacted planetary habitability. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of galactic habitability, emphasizing that the path a star takes within the Milky Way can significantly affect its surrounding environment and the potential for life. We propose a new concept of “Galactic habitable orbits,” which accounts for evolving galactic structures and their effects on stellar and planetary systems.

Powerful nuclear outflows and circumgalactic medium shocks driven by the most luminous quasar in the Universe,"Abstract:We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous quasar known at $z=4.6$. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s$^{-1}$, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of 6$\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.",12/3/2024,"['interstellar', 'galaxies', 'galactic', 'nuclear', 'spectroscopy']"

"Clusters, Clumps, Dust, &\&& Gas (CCDG) in NGC 1614: Bench-marking Cluster Demographics in Extreme Systems","Observations of young star clusters in a variety of galaxies have been used to constrain basic properties related to star-formation, such as the fraction of stars found in clusters (ΓΓ\Gammaroman_Γ) and the shape of the cluster mass function.However, the results can depend heavily on the reliability of the cluster age-dating process and other assumptions.One of the biggest challenges for successful age-dating lies in breaking the age-reddening degeneracy, where older, dust-free clusters and young, reddened clusters can have similar broad-band colors.While this degeneracy affects cluster populations in all galaxies, it is particularly challenging in dusty, extreme star-forming environments systems.We study the cluster demographics in the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 1614 using Hubble imaging taken in 8 optical-near infrared passbands.For age-dating, we adopt a spectral energy distribution fitting process that limits the maximum allowed reddening by region, and includes Hα𝛼\alphaitalic_α photometry directly.We find that without these assumptions, essentially all clusters in the dust-free UV-bright arm which should have ages ≈50−250absent50250\approx 50-250≈ 50 - 250 Myr are incorrectly assigned ages younger than 10 Myr.We find this method greatly reduces the number of clusters in the youngest (τ𝜏\tauitalic_τ <<< 10 Myrs) age bin and shows a fairly uniform distribution of massive clusters, the most massive being ≈few×107⁢M⊙absentfewsuperscript107subscriptMdirect-product\approx\mbox{few}\times 10^{7}~{}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}≈ few × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.A maximum likelihood fit shows that the cluster mass function is well fitted by a power-law with an index ∼similar-to\sim∼-1.8, with no statistically significant high-mass cutoff.We calculate the fraction of stars born in clusters to be Γ1−10subscriptΓ110\Gamma_{1-10}roman_Γ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 - 10 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 22.4%percent\%% ±plus-or-minus\pm± 5.7%percent\%%.

Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. III - The triggering of active galactic nuclei peaks immediately after coalescence,"Galaxy mergers have been shown to trigger active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the nearby universe, but the timescale over which this process happens remains unconstrained. The Multi-Model Merger Identifier (mummi) machine vision pipeline has been demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of time post-merger (TP⁢Msubscript𝑇𝑃𝑀T_{PM}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P italic_M end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) for galaxies selected from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared and Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) up to TP⁢Msubscript𝑇𝑃𝑀T_{PM}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P italic_M end_POSTSUBSCRIPT=1.76 Gyr after coalescence. By combining the post-mergers identified in UNIONS with pre-coalescence galaxy pairs, we can, for the first time, study the triggering of AGN throughout the merger sequence. AGN are identified using a range of complementary metrics: mid-IR colours, narrow emission lines and broad emission lines, which can be combined to provide insight into the demographics of dust and luminosity of the AGN population. Our main results are: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess (compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence, at 0<TP⁢M<0.160subscript𝑇𝑃𝑀0.160<T_{PM}<0.160 < italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P italic_M end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after coalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common than in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96<TP⁢M0.96subscript𝑇𝑃𝑀0.96<T_{PM}0.96 < italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P italic_M end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and bolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminious than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN in the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is consistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring material. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering fraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN clears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the triggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of coalescence.",12/3/2024,"['galaxies', 'starbursts', 'galactic', 'galaxy', 'nuclear']"
A Simulated Galaxy Laboratory:Exploring the Observational Effects on UV Spectral Absorption Line Measurements,"Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of HI ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used SiII lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find under-predictions on average of 1.25 dex. We show that the under-prediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight-lines that are optically-thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.",12/3/2024,"['spectroscopy', 'interstellar', 'ionizing', 'spectral', 'photons']"

Dark Galactic subhalos and the Gaia snail,"Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution.

On the S-stars’ Zone of Avoidance in the Galactic Center,"This paper investigates the origin and orbital evolution of S-stars in the Galactic Center using models of binary disruption and relaxation processes.

We demonstrate that the observed S-star orbital distributions, including this zone of avoidance and their thermal eccentricity distribution, can be largely explained by continuous disruption of binaries near the central supermassive black hole, followed by orbital relaxation. Our models consider binaries originating from large scales (5555–100100100100 pc) and incorporate empirical distributions of binary properties. We simulate close encounters between binaries and the black hole, tracking the remnant stars’ orbits. The initially highly eccentric orbits of disrupted binary remnants evolve due to non-resonant and resonant relaxation in the Galactic Center potential. While our results provide insights into the formation mechanism of S-stars, there are limitations, such as uncertainties in the initial binary population and mass-function and simplifications in our relaxation models. Despite these caveats, our study demonstrates the power of using S-star distributions to probe the dynamical history and environment of the central parsec of our Galaxy.",12/3/2024,['Key Words.: black hole physics – Galaxy: center']

Additionally, both the [O iii] and Hα𝛼\alphaitalic_α+[N ii] lines show prominent broad (∼similar-to\sim∼1300 km s-1), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas.

Synoptic Wide-field EVN–e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) – I. First steps towards commensal surveys with VLBI,"The high angular resolution and sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offer a unique tool to identify and study active galactic nuclei and star-formation activity over cosmic time.However, despite recent technical advances, such as multiple phase centre correlation, VLBI surveys have thus far been limited to either a few well-studied deep-fields or wide-areas to a relatively shallow depth. To enter the era of extensive statistical studies at high angular resolution, a significantly larger area of the sky must be observed to much better sensitivity with VLBI. The Synoptic Wide-field EVN–e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) is a proposed commensal observing mode for the EVN and e-MERLIN, where single-target principle investigator-led observations are re-correlated at the position of known radio sources within 12 arcmin of the pointing centre. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this methodology by detecting a 5.6 mJy core-jet object at 1.7 GHz that would have otherwise been lost from the parent data set. This is the first object to be recovered as part of the SWEEPS pilot programme, which highlights the potential for increasing sample sizes of VLBI-detected radio sources with commensal observing modes in the near future.",12/3/2024,"['cosmic', 'galactic', 'interferometry', 'ghz', 'extensive']"
Improving Optical Photo-z Estimates Using Submillimeter Photometry,"Estimating the redshifts of distant galaxies is critical for determining their intrinsic properties, as well as for using them as cosmological probes. Measuring redshifts spectroscopically is accurate, but expensive in terms of telescope time, hence it has become common to measure ‘photometric’ redshifts, which are fits to photometry taken in a number of filters using templates of galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, most photometric methods rely on optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, neglecting longer wavelength data in the far-infrared (FIR) and millimeter. Since the ultimate goal of future surveys is to obtain redshift estimates for all galaxies, it is important to improve photometric redshift algorithms for cases where optical/NIR fits fail to produce reliable results. For specific subsets of galaxies, in particular dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), it can be particularly hard to obtain good optical photometry and thus reliable photometric redshift estimates, while these same galaxies are often bright at longer wavelengths. Here we describe a new method for independently incorporating FIR-to-millimeter photometry to the outputs of standard optical/NIR SED-fitting codes to help improve redshift estimation, in particular of DSFGs. We test our method with the H-ATLAS catalog, which contains FIR photometry from Herschel-SPIRE cross-matched to optical and NIR observations, and show that our approach reduces the number of catastrophic outliers by a factor of three compared to standard optical and NIR SED-fitting routines alone.",12/4/2024,"['galaxies: photometry', ' far-infrared — galaxies: dusty', ' starbursts — submillimeter: galaxies']"

To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond,"It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncing cosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entire evolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singular bounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, the vector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed without encountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that such models unavoidably lead to either an instability in the matter sector or strong coupling in the scalar one. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independent way, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singular bounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found for Horndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyond generalized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamical nature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it an ill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.",12/5/2024,"['cosmology', 'relativity', 'instability', 'theorem', 'pathologies']"

Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. We show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and are therefore expected to have only a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. We also provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$",12/5/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'antineutrinos', 'plasma', 'decoupling']"
Eogenesis via the High-scale Electroweak Symmetry Restoration,"In this paper, we propose a novel electron-assisted Baryogenesis scenario that does not require explicit B-L violation, which is essential for the traditional Leptogenesis mechanism. This scenario is based on the assumption of high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, which implies that the electron Yukawa interaction, crucial for the mechanism, does not reach thermal equilibrium before the electroweak sphaleron process is quenched in the early universe. Primordial charge asymmetries for chiral electrons, which can be generated through various mechanisms such as axion inflation, the evaporation of primordial black holes, or the CP-asymmetric decays of a heavy Higgs doublet, serve as the initial condition for the amplification of the baryon asymmetry through transport equations. Right-handed electron asymmetry is almost irrelevant to the baryon asymmetry due to high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, leading to both a non-zero baryon asymmetry and the electron asymmetry. We dub this mechanism as the Eogenesis.",12/5/2024,"['electroweak', 'electrons', 'electron', 'novel', 'leptogenesis']"

Direct Deflection of Millicharged Radiation,"Millicharged particles are generic in theories of dark sectors.A cosmic or local abundance of them may be produced by the early universe, stellar environments, or the decay or annihilation of dark matter/dark energy. Furthermore, if such particles are light, these production channels result in a background of millicharged radiation. We show that light-shining-through-wall experiments employing superconducting RF cavities can also be used as “direct deflection” experiments to search for this relativistic background. The millicharged plasma is first subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic field of a driven cavity, which causes charge separation in the form of charge and current perturbations. In turn, these perturbations can propagate outwards and resonantly excite electromagnetic fields in a well-shielded cavity placed nearby, enabling detection.

Picture Perfect: Photometric Transient Classification Using the ParSNIP Model with Roman Hourglass Simulations,"The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4-meter primary mirror and optical–NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core Community Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will measure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this number with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically classified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate transient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) framework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman HLTDS. This study leverages this Roman “Hourglass” dataset to train and evaluate the ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ this model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying particular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe Ia, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model’s performance is assessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift ranges.

Learning from galactic rotation curves: a neural network approach,"For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer parameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle mass m𝑚mitalic_m, scaling parameter s𝑠sitalic_s, core-to-envelope transition radius rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and NFW scale radius rssubscript𝑟𝑠r_{s}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar mass-to-light ratio Υ∗subscriptΥ\Upsilon_{*}roman_Υ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT)?In this work, using simulated rotation curves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer parameter values and their uncertainties.Since observed rotation curves have errors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data on the inference.We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods.We find that the trained neural networks can extract parameters that describe observations well for the galaxies we studied.",12/4/2024,"['galaxies', 'galaxy', 'upsilon_', 'curves', 'roman_υ']"
"Reducing nuisance prior sensitivity via non-linear reparameterization, with application to EFT analyses of large-scale structure","Many physical models contain nuisance parameters that quantify unknown and irrelevant properties of an experiment. Typically, these cannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the experiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that are our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of interest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT) models to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences. These models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically correlated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong dependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization method that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate nuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in the presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a natural basis within which to define priors that are independent between nuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal posterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed on nuisance terms.In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.",12/4/2024,"['cosmological', 'nuisance', 'reparametrization', 'theory', 'experiment']"
Accelerating HI density predictions during the Epoch of Reionization using a GPR-based emulator on N-body simulations,"Building fast and accurate ways to model the distribution of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is essential for interpreting upcoming 21 cm observations.

Using high-dynamic range N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and semi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy. In this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can generate fcollsubscript𝑓collf_{\text{coll}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT coll end_POSTSUBSCRIPT maps by sampling from the full distribution of fcollsubscript𝑓collf_{\text{coll}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT coll end_POSTSUBSCRIPT conditioned on the dark matter density contrast δ𝛿\deltaitalic_δ. The conditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are taken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run. We evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a high-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these fcollsubscript𝑓collf_{\text{coll}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT coll end_POSTSUBSCRIPT maps, we compute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization.

The relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the filamentary cosmic web,"We use the Millennium Simulation to study the relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the cosmic web.

This difference arises because a large fraction of all satellite and backsplash galaxies are part of the cosmic web.

As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR’s) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are identical in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.",12/4/2024,"['galaxies', 'superscript1011', 'superscript1012', 'superscript108', 'cosmic']"

Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction,"Abstract:Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free",12/3/2024,"['cosmic', 'atomic', 'space', 'molecular', 'recombination']"
The imprint of cosmic voids from the DESI Legacy Survey DR9 LRGs in the Planck 2018 lensing map through spectroscopically calibrated mocks,"The cross-correlation of cosmic voids with the lensing convergence (κ𝜅\kappaitalic_κ) map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations provides a powerful tool to refine our understanding of the current cosmological model.

To address this ”lensing-is-low” tension and to obtain new, precise measurements of the signal, we exploit the large DESI Legacy Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) dataset, covering approximately 19,500 deg2superscriptdegree2\deg^{2}roman_deg start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT of the sky and including about 10 million LRGs at z<1.05𝑧1.05z<1.05italic_z < 1.05.

The difference highlights the potential of using WL peaks to constrain cosmology.

Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data,"Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods.For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies.For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH (Mtot<0.13⁢eVsubscript𝑀tot0.13eVM_{\mathrm{tot}}<0.13\,\mathrm{eV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_tot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.13 roman_eV) or IH (Mtot<0.16⁢eVsubscript𝑀tot0.16eVM_{\mathrm{tot}}<0.16\,\mathrm{eV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_tot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.16 roman_eV) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation (Mtot<0.086⁢eVsubscript𝑀tot0.086eVM_{\mathrm{tot}}<0.086\,\mathrm{eV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_tot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.086 roman_eV).The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH.Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.",12/4/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'microwave', 'cosmic', 'planck']"
Self-interactions of ultralight spinless dark matter to the rescue?,"Numerous observations on astrophysical and cosmological scales can be interpreted to mean that, in addition to the familiar kind of matter well described by the standard model of elementary particle physics, there exists Dark Matter (DM). The fundamental properties of the elementary particles which make up the DM e.g. particle mass, spin, couplings etc are currently being observationally constrained. In particular, if DM particles have spin zero, there exist recent constraints which suggest a lower limit on its mass which is often a couple of orders of magnitude larger than 10−22superscript102210^{-22}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 22 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT eV.

Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations,"Abstract:Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.",12/4/2024,"['radiation', 'ghz', 'cosmic', 'synchrotron', 'luminosity']"

Effective Field Theory and In-In Correlators,"Abstract:The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.",12/3/2024,"['spacetimes', 'quantum', 'cosmological', 'renormalization', 'space']"

Stage IV CMB forecasts for warm inflation,"We report forecasted constraints on warm inflation in the light of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys, with data expected to be available in the coming decade. These observations could finally give us the missing information necessary to unveil the production of gravitational waves during inflation, reflected by detecting a non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio crucial to the B-mode power spectrum of the CMB. We consider the impact of three future surveys, namely the CMB-S4, Simons Observatory, and the space-borne LiteBIRD, in restricting the parameter space of four typical warm inflationary models in the context of a quartic potential, which is well motivated theoretically. We find that all three surveys significantly improve the models’ parameter space, compared to recentresults obtained with current Planck+BICEP/Keck Array data. Moreover, the combination of ground-based and space-borne (CMB-S4+LiteBIRD) tightens the constraints so that we expect to distinguish even better warm inflation scenarios.

Impact of blending on weak lensing measurements with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time,"Upcoming deep optical surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will scan the sky to unprecedented depths, detecting billions of galaxies. However, this amount of detections will lead to the apparent superposition of galaxies in the images, a phenomenon known as blending, that can affect the accurate measurement of individual galaxy properties. In particular, galaxy shapes play a crucial role in estimating the masses of large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters, through weak gravitational lensing.This proceeding introduces a new catalog matching algorithm, friendly, designed for detecting and characterizing blends in simulated LSST data for the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2. The aim of this algorithm is to combine several matching procedures, as well as a probabilistic method to quantify blended systems.By removing the resulted 27% of galaxies affected by blending from the dataset, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the excess surface mass density Δ⁢ΣΔΣ\Delta\Sigmaroman_Δ roman_Σ weak lensing profile — potentially biased low due to blending — may be partially corrected.",12/3/2024,"['galaxies', 'galaxy', 'science', 'gravitational', 'observatory']"
Bayesian data analysis for sky-averaged 21-cm experiments with contamination from linearly polarised foregrounds,"The precise measurement of the sky-averaged HI absorption signal between 50 and 200 MHz is the primary goal of global 21-cm cosmology. This measurement has the potential to unravel the underlying physics of cosmic structure formation and evolution during the Cosmic Dawn. It is, however, hindered by various non-smooth, frequency-dependent effects, whose structures resemble those of the signal. One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the measured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday rotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium, imprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which complicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature. We investigate the effect of polarised Galactic foregrounds on extracting the global 21-cm signal from simulated data using REACH’s data analysis pipeline; the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is an experiment designed to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm HI signal from the early Universe using physically informed models. Using the REACH pipeline, we successfully recover an injected global 21-cm signal with an amplitude of approximately 0.16 K, centred between 80 and 120 MHz, achieving a low root-mean-square error (less than 30% of the injected signal strength) in all the tested cases. This includes scenarios with simulated polarised Galactic diffuse emissions and polarised point source emissions, provided the overall polarisation fraction is below ∼3%similar-toabsentpercent3\sim 3\%∼ 3 %.

Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with 𝜶𝜶\alphabold_italic_α-attractors,"A plethora of inflationary models have been shown to produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW).Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales.In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds.We consider the case of hybrid cosmological α𝛼\alphaitalic_α-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, 𝒫ζsubscript𝒫𝜁\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}caligraphic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and its amplitude.We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for 𝒫ζsubscript𝒫𝜁\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}caligraphic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on μ𝜇\muitalic_μ-distortions.We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages.We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude fNL∼𝒪⁢(0.1)similar-tosubscript𝑓NL𝒪0.1f_{\text{NL}}\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT NL end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∼ caligraphic_O ( 0.1 ).This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level 𝒫ζsubscript𝒫𝜁\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}caligraphic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests.The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs.We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds.Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.As such, it represents the first step towards establishing a paradigm for constraining inflation on all scales.",12/3/2024,"['cosmological', 'anisotropies', 'astrophysical', 'muitalic_μ', 'theoretical']"
Formation of solitons and their transitions in scalar-field dark matter models with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential,"We study the formation of solitons inside scalar-fielddark matter halos with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential. We considera self-interaction potential that is quartic in the scalar field in the low-density regimebut saturates at large densities. This mimics the behaviour of axion monodromy potentials.We concentrate on the semi-classical regime, where the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than thesize of the system. We find that depending on the strength and scale of the self-interactions, the systemcan form solitons of the Thomas-Fermi type (dominated by self-interactions) or of the FuzzyDark Matter type (dominated by the quantum pressure). The system can also display transitionsfrom a Thomas-Fermi soliton to a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton as the former becomes unstable.We show that these behaviours can be understood from a simple Gaussian ansatz.We find that even in cases where the self-interactions are always subdominant they can playa critical role, by providing a small density boost that is enough to generate the seed for theformation of a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton at much later times.We also point out that the intuition derived from a hydrodynamical picture can be misleadingin regimes where wave effects are important.",12/3/2024,"['quantum', 'transitionsfrom', 'soliton', 'halos', 'solitons']"

Simulation-based inference has its own Dodelson-Schneider effect (but it knows that it does),"Context. Making inferences about physical properties of the Universe requires knowledge of the data likelihood. A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it distorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the location of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from SBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the same problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from simulations.",12/3/2024,['Key Words.: Simulation-based Inference – Data Analysis – Machine Learning']

A Global Perspective with Updated Constraints on the Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-19b: Atmospheric Properties and Stellar Activity,"Abstract:We present a detailed reanalysis of the atmospheric properties of WASP-19b, an ultra-hot Jupiter (1.14 M Jup, 1.41 R Jup) orbiting an active Sun-like star every 0.79 day. We reanalyze a transit and secondary eclipse of WASP-19b observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph (1.1 - 1.7 microns). When combined with Spitzer photometry at longer wavelengths, our analyses indicate the presence of water absorption features in both the planet's transmission and emission spectra, consistent with results from previously published studies. We jointly fit WASP-19b's dayside emission and transmission spectra with a retrieval model in order to constrain its atmospheric composition, and explore the effect of stellar activity on its transmission spectrum in greater depth. We also compare our dayside emission spectrum to predictions from a general circulation model, and conclude that magnetic drag appears to be relatively unimportant in shaping WASP-19b's atmospheric circulation. Lastly, we compare the size of WASP-19b's dayside water absorption feature to the population of hot Jupiters with similar measurements, and show that it is located in the transitional irradiation regime where temperature inversions first begin to emerge. As in previous studies, we find that the current observations provide relatively weak constraints on this planet's atmospheric properties. These constraints could be significantly improved by the addition of spectroscopically resolved observations at longer wavelengths with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM.",12/4/2024,"['jupiter', 'jupiters', 'eclipse', 'telescope', 'wasp']"
JWST-TST DREAMS: A Precise Water Abundance for Hot Jupiter WASP-17b from the NIRISS SOSS Transmission Spectrum,"Water has proven to be ubiquitously detected in near-infrared (NIR) transmission spectroscopy observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, including WASP-17b. However, previous analyses of WASP-17b’s atmosphere based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance, finding that sub-solar, super-solar and bimodal posterior distributions were all statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b using JWST’s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRISS SOSS) mode. We analyze our data using three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement between results.

Using the Difference of the Inclinations of a Pair of Counter-Orbiting Satellites to Measure the Lense–Thirring Effect,"Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary along ideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the general expressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by the post–Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the central object, it turns out that the Lense–Thirring inclination rates of A and B are equal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary’s oblateness are identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the two orbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects by enhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbital configurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observable consequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenario involving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt in the mid–1970s, is considered. A comparison with the ongoing experiment with the LAser GEOdynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) 2 is made.",12/5/2024,['classical general relativity; experimental studies of gravity; experimental tests of gravitational theories; satellite orbits; harmonics of the gravity potential field']
Angular Momentum Drain: Despinning Embedded Planetesimals,"Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in a protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta distributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for impacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque exerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum drain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in the low velocity regime of a disk wind.Though spin-down associated with impacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is inefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the gravitational focusing regime, though even less efficiently than for lower mass planetesimals. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind speed is low, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is composed of low-strength material.Due to its inefficiency, we find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a pebble cloud does not by itself facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.",12/4/2024,"['asteroids', 'planetesimals', 'planetesimal', 'protostellar', 'crater']"
Transiting Jupiters around M-dwarfs have similar masses to FGK warm-Jupiters,"Abstract:This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ($\gtrsim$ 8$R_{\oplus}$) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ( $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published non-detections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.",12/4/2024,"['exoplanets', 'jupiters', 'dwarfs', 'dwarf', 'planets']"
"A dark, bare rock for TOI-1685 b from a JWST NIRSpec G395H phase curve","We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H2-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98±0.07plus-or-minus0.980.070.98\pm 0.070.98 ± 0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823–5.172 µm).

Exomoons of Circumbinary Planets,"Exomoon discovery is on the horizon. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Circumbinary planets are predicted to have migrated to their current location from a farther region of the protoplanetary disc where they formed. An exomoon of a CBP therefore represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation in more dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within ∼5−10%similar-toabsent5percent10\sim 5-10\%∼ 5 - 10 % of the planet’s Hill Radius. Roughly 30−40%30percent4030-40\%30 - 40 % of the surviving moons are in the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability even if the known CBPs all gas giants. The majority of moons fall off of their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). A subset of exomoons are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents a new mechanism for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected in the Roman microlensing survey.",12/3/2024,"['moon', 'moons', 'planets', 'planetary', 'protoplanetary']"
Accretion of Uranus and Neptune: confronting different giant impact scenarios,"The origins of Uranus and Neptune are not fully understood. Their inclined rotation axes – obliquities – suggest that they experienced giant impacts during their formation histories. Simulations modeling their accretion from giant impacts among ∼similar-to\sim∼5 Earth masses planetary embryos – with roughly unity impactors’ mass ratios – have been able to broadly match their current masses, final mass ratio, and obliquity. However, due to angular momentum conservation, planets produced in these impacts tend to rotate too fast, compared to Uranus and Neptune. One potential solution for this problem consists of invoking instead collisions of objects with large mass ratios (e.g. a proto-Uranus with 13 M⊕ and an embryo of 1 M⊕). Smooth-particle hydrodynamics simulations show that in this scenario final planets tend to have rotation periods more consistent with those of Uranus and Neptune. Here we performed a large suite of N-body numerical simulations modelling the formation of Uranus and Neptune to compare these different dynamical views. Our simulations start with a population of protoplanets and account for the effects of type-I migration, inclination and eccentricity tidal damping. Our results show that although scenarios allowing for large impactors’ mass ratio favour slower rotating planets, the probability of occurring collisions in these specific simulations is significantly low. This is because gas tidal damping is relatively less efficient for low-mass embryos (≲less-than-or-similar-to\lesssim≲1 M⊕) and, consequently, such objects are mostly scattered by more massive objects (∼similar-to\sim∼13 M⊕) instead of colliding with them. Altogether, our results show that the probability of broadly matching the masses, mass ratio, and rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune in these two competing formation scenarios is broadly similar, within a factor of ∼similar-to\sim∼2, with overall probabilities of the order of ∼similar-to\sim∼0.1-1%.",12/3/2024,"['giant', 'planetary', 'fast', 'eccentricity', 'massive']"

History and Habitability of the LP 890-9 Planetary System,"We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star’s pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c’s orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.",12/3/2024,['astrobiology - methods: numerical - software: simulations - planets and satellites: individual: LP 890-9: dynamical evolution and stability - planets-star interactions']

Increased Surface Temperatures of Habitable White Dwarf WorldsRelative to Main-Sequence Exoplanets,"Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars—a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature—and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet’s global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.",12/3/2024,['planetary systems—radiative transfer—stars: white dwarfs—astrobiology']

Recent studies claim that pebble accretion could potentially, among other things, explain the mass and orbits of the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, the size and water contents of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and the formation of Super-Earth systems at small orbital radii. However, all these studies start with planetary embryos much larger than those expected from the streaming instability.",12/3/2024,['Key Words.: planets and satellites: formation –methods: numerical –protoplanetary disk']
Machine Learning Methods for Automated Interstellar Object Classification with LSST,"The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification.This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data.We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data.Our results demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables (right ascension, declination, and magnitude) in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively.These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey’s potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.",12/3/2024,"['Interstellar Objects', ' LSST', ' Vera Rubin Observatory', ' Machine learning', ' Short-arc Orbit Determination', ' Near-Earth Objects', ' Astronomy', ' Solar System']"
The Terminator Region Atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab with ESPRESSO/VLT observations,"Atmospheric studies are essential for elucidating the formation history, evolutionary processes, and atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets.

A dry Venusian interior constrained by atmospheric chemistry,"Venus’s climatic history provides powerful constraint on the location of the inner-edge of the liquid-water habitable zone. However, two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years, with surface liquid water, and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer a novel constraint on Venus’s climate history by inferring the water content of its interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of \ceH2O, \ceCO2 and \ceOCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain atmospheric stability, we show Venus’s interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases have at most a 6% water mole fraction, substantially drier than terrestrial magmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with Venus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a long-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus’s atmosphere therefore indicates that the planet has never been ‘liquid-water’ habitable.",12/2/2024,"['venus', 'venusian', 'volcanic', 'magmas', 'magma']"
The Origins of Lithium Enhancement in Polluted White Dwarfs,"Abstract:The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644$-$0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644$-$0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal's origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.",12/2/2024,"['dwarfs', 'exoplanetesimals', 'lithium', 'nucleosynthesis', 'j1636']"
Identifying Hierarchically Triple Star Systems with Gaia DR3 and LAMOST,"Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data, 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. And we compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 tripls, revealing a range of Δ⁢VΔ𝑉\Delta Vroman_Δ italic_V from approximately 40 km/s to 210 km/s. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45 km/s in binaries and below 90 km/s in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2–20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.",12/3/2024,['Triple stars (1714); Multiple stars (1081); Radial velocity (1332); Eclipsing binary stars(444); Light curves(918)']
New insight of time-transformed symplectic integrator I: hybrid methods for hierarchical triples,"Accurate N𝑁Nitalic_N-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries.The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems.The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error.We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic.Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric.The method is implemented in the few-body code sdar.We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems.These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.",12/3/2024,['N-body simulations (1083) — N-body problem (1082) — Multiple stars (1081) — Few-body systems (531)']
Uranus Study Report,"Abstract:Determining the internal structure of Uranus is a key objective for planetary science. Knowledge of Uranus's bulk composition and the distribution of elements is crucial to understanding its origin and evolutionary path. In addition, Uranus represents a poorly understood class of intermediate-mass planets (intermediate in size between the relatively well studied terrestrial and gas giant planets), which appear to be very common in the Galaxy. As a result, a better characterization of Uranus will also help us to better understand exoplanets in this mass and size regime. Recognizing the importance of Uranus, a Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) workshop was held in September 2023 to investigate how we can improve our knowledge of Uranus's internal structure in the context of a future Uranus mission that includes an orbiter and a probe. The scientific goals and objectives of the recently released Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey were taken as our starting point. We reviewed our current knowledge of Uranus's interior and identified measurement and other mission requirements for a future Uranus spacecraft, providing more detail than was possible in the Decadal Survey's mission study and including new insights into the measurements to be made. We also identified important knowledge gaps to be closed with Earth-based efforts in the near term that will help guide the design of the mission and interpret the data returned.",12/2/2024,"['astrobiology', 'exoplanets', 'uranus', 'orbiter', 'planetary']"
UV-processing of icy pebbles in the outer parts of VSI-turbulent disks,"Icy dust particles emerge in star-forming clouds and are subsequently incorporated in protoplanetary disks, where they coagulate into larger pebbles up to mm in size. In the disk midplane, ices are shielded from UV radiation, but moderate levels of disk turbulence can lift small particles to the disk surface, where they can be altered, or destroyed. Nevertheless, studies of comets and meteorites generally find that ices at least partly retained their interstellar medium (ISM) composition before being accreted onto these minor bodies. Here we model this process through hydrodynamical simulations with VSI-driven turbulence in the outer protoplanetary disk. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5 D global accretion setup and include Lagrangian dust particles of 0.1 and 1 mm sizes. In a post-processing step, we use the RADMC3D code to generate the local UV radiation field to assess the level of ice processing of pebbles. We find that a small fraction (∼similar-to\sim∼17%percent\%%) of 100 μ𝜇\muitalic_μm size particles are frequently lifted up to Z/R=0.2𝑍𝑅0.2Z/R=0.2italic_Z / italic_R = 0.2 which can result in the loss of their pristine composition as their residence time in this layer allows for effective CO and water photodissociation. The larger 1 mm size particles remain UV-shielded in the disk midplane throughout the dynamical evolution of the disk. Our results indicate that the assembly of icy bodies via the accretion of drifting mm-size icy pebbles can explain the presence of pristine ice from the ISM, even in VSI-turbulent disks. Nevertheless, particles ≤\leq≤ 100 μ𝜇\muitalic_μm experience efficient UV processing and may mix with unaltered icy pebbles, resulting in a less ISM-like composition in the midplane.",12/2/2024,['Key Words.: gas and dust dynamics –thermal and photochemistry –protoplanetary disk evolution']

Concealing Circumbinary Planets with Tidal Shrinkage,"Of the 14 transiting planets that have been detected orbiting eclipsing binaries (‘circumbinary planets’), none have been detected with stellar binary orbital periods shorter than 7 days, despite such binaries existing in abundance. The eccentricity-period data for stellar binaries indicates that short-period (<7absent7<7< 7 day) binaries have had their orbits tidally circularized.We examine here to what extent tidal circularization and shrinkage can conceal circumbinary planets, i.e. whether planets actually exist around short-period binaries, but are not detected because their transit probabilities drop as tides shrink the binary away from the planet. We carry out a population synthesis by initializing a population of eccentric stellar binaries hosting circumbinary planets, and then circularizing and tightening the host orbits using stellar tides.To match the circumbinary transit statistics,stellar binaries must form with eccentricities ≳greater-than-or-equivalent-to\gtrsim≳ 0.2 and periods ≳greater-than-or-equivalent-to\gtrsim≳ 6 days, with circumbinary planets emplaced on exterior stable orbits before tidal circularization; moreover, tidal dissipation must be efficient enough to circularize and shrink binaries out to ∼similar-to\sim∼6–8 days. The resultant binaries that shrink to sub-7-day periods no longer host transiting planets.However, this scenario cannot explain the formation of nearly circular, tight binaries, brought to their present sub-seven-day orbits from other processes like disk migration.Still, tidal shrinkage can introduce a bias against finding transiting circumbinary planets, and predicts a population of KIC 3853259 (AB)b analogs consisting of wide-separation, non-transiting planets orbiting tight binaries.",12/2/2024,"['planets', '3853259', 'planet', 'eccentricities', '7absent7']"

Hydrodynamical simulations of proto-Moon degassing,"Modeling the isotopic and elemental abundance of the bulk silicate Moon represent major challenges. Similarities in the non-mass dependent isotopic composition of refractory elements with the bulk silicate Earth suggest that both the Earth and the Moon formed from the same material reservoir. On the other hand, the Moon’s volatile depletion and isotopic composition of moderately volatile elements points to a global devolatilization processes, most likely during a magma ocean phase of the Moon. Here, we investigate the devolatilisation of the molten Moon due to a tidally-assisted hydrodynamic escape, first proposed by Charnoz et al. (2021), with a focus on the dynamics of the evaporated gas. Unlike the 1D steady-state approach of Charnoz et al. (2021), we use 2D time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations carried out with the FARGOCA code modified to take into account the magma ocean as a gas source. Near the Earth’s Roche limit, where the proto-Moon likely formed, evaporated gases from the lunar magma ocean form a circum-Earth disk of volatiles, with less than 30% of material being re-accreted by the Moon. We find that the measured depletion of K and Na on the Moon can be achieved if the lunar magma-ocean had a surface temperature of about 1800-2000 K. After about 1000 years, a thermal boundary layer or a flotation crust forms a lid that inhibits volatile escape. Mapping the volatile velocity field reveals varying trends in the longitudes of volatile reaccretion on the Moon’s surface: material is predominantly re-accreted on the trailing side when the Moon-Earth distance exceeds 3.5 Earth radii. For k2/Qsubscript𝑘2𝑄k_{2}/Qitalic_k start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_Q values of 0.0003 and 0.03, 60% and more than 99% of the volatile material, respectively, is re-accreted on the trailing side, suggesting a dichotomy in volatile abundances between the leading and trailing sides of the Moon. This dichotomy may provide insights on the tidal conditions of the early molten Earth. In conclusion, tidally-driven atmospheric escape effectively devolatilizes the Moon, matching the measured abundances of Na and K on timescales compatible with the formation of a thermal boundary layer or an anorthite flotation crust.",12/2/2024,"['moon', 'lunar', 'magma', 'hydrodynamic', 'anorthite']"

Terrestrial atmospheric ion implantation occurred in the nearside lunar regolith during the history of Earth’s dynamo,"Abstract:Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence of geomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitive geodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear, and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition and poorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHD numerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetized atmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects this transfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signature provides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetized epoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrial atmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunar soils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples are very sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ion implantation, was never smaller than 190 km.",11/30/2024,"['lunar', 'moon', 'magnetotail', 'solar', 'geodynamo']"
Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas,"Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the Hillas limit is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles — those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments — often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy (∼similar-to\sim∼100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected.

Multi-wavelength Study of Dust Emission in the Young Edge-on Protostellar Disk HH 212,"Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets.Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations.To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm).We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index β𝛽\mathrm{\beta}italic_β of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source.For the VLA bands, since the continuum emission of the disk is more contaminated by the free-free emission at longer wavelengths, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling.The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index β𝛽\betaitalic_β (with a value of ∼similar-to\sim∼ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be ∼similar-to\sim∼ 130 μ𝜇\muitalic_μm, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk.",11/30/2024,['Protoplanetary disks (1300) — Interstellar scattering(854) — Interstellar dust(836) — Interstellar medium(847)']

Emphasizing the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observe that the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode’s frequency decreases for slow phase transitions.

Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions,"Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with n≤5𝑛5n\leq 5italic_n ≤ 5 in the fully relativistic limit (with n𝑛nitalic_n being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant fasubscript𝑓𝑎f_{a}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions.

Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks:The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations,"Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments.

At high ℳAsubscriptℳ𝐴\mathcal{M}_{A}caligraphic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low ℳAsubscriptℳ𝐴\mathcal{M}_{A}caligraphic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration.

Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf,"Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope.

Power of simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for probing AGN outflows,"Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies.Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism.Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN.However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power.In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN.The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept.The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy.Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.",12/4/2024,"['spectrometers', 'physics', 'galaxies', 'ionized', 'spectroscopy']"

Revising the Spin and Kick Connection in Isolated Binary Black Holes,"The origin of black hole (BH) spins remains one of the least understood aspects of BHs. Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs originated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems from the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In this study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms that can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal spins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel to natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms leave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin magnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging binaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating in the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin (χeff<0subscript𝜒eff0\chi_{\rm eff}<0italic_χ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0). This broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into regimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled binaries.",12/4/2024,"['0italic_χ', 'misalignments', 'black', 'isotropically', 'orbital']"

Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles,"We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs’ ejecta is ≃80%similar-to-or-equalsabsentpercent80\simeq 80\%≃ 80 % of the pre-explosion WDs’ orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200−5400⁢km⁢s−142005400kmsuperscripts14200-5400{~{}\rm km}{~{}\rm s}^{-1}4200 - 5400 roman_km roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94⁢M⊙subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀20.94subscript𝑀direct-productM_{1}=M_{2}=0.94M_{\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.94 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey: VII. Six millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with massive white dwarf companions,"Binary millisecond pulsars with a massive white dwarf (WD) companion are intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). They are formed via the Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) evolution channel if they are in compact orbits with an orbital period of less than 1 day. They are fairly rare in the known pulsar population, only five such IMBPs have been discovered before, and one of them is in a globular cluster. Here we report six IMBPs in a compact orbit, PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1919+1341, J1943+2210, J1947+2304 and J2023+2853, discovered during the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), doubling the number of such IMBPs due to the high survey sensitivity in the short survey time of 5 minutes.

Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: parameters in reconnection models,"Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.",12/4/2024,"['astrophysical', 'plasma', 'magnetic', 'theoretical', 'reconnection']"

X-ray Spectral and Timing Properties of the Black Hole Binary XTE J1859+226 and their Relation to Jets,"We compiled the X-ray and soft gamma-ray observations of the Galactic black hole binary XTE J1859+226 in the 1999–2000 outburst from RXTE, ASCA, BeppoSAX and CGRO.Throughout systematic spectral analysis using a two-component model consisting of a multi-temperature accretion disk plus a fraction of its flux convolved with an empirical Comptonized powerlaw component, we found that the innermost radius (rinsubscript𝑟inr_{\rm in}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and temperature (Tinsubscript𝑇inT_{\rm in}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) of the disk are very variable with time in the rising phase of soft X-ray flux where Type-A/B/C low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found. After this phase, rinsubscript𝑟inr_{\rm in}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT remains constant at around 60 km assuming a distance of 8 kpc and an inclination angle of 67∘, and Tinsubscript𝑇inT_{\rm in}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT smoothly decays with time.

Accurate determinations of the frequency–rinsubscript𝑟inr_{\rm in}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT relation for various objects should be a powerful tool to discriminate plausible Type-C QPO models.Furthermore, we suggest that jet ejection events may occur when rinsubscript𝑟inr_{\rm in}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT rapidly approaches to the ISCO, along with rapid changes of the disk flux, the rms variability and the hardness ratio.A rapid shrinkage of rinsubscript𝑟inr_{\rm in}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_in end_POSTSUBSCRIPT down to the ISCO can be a useful index as a precursor of radio flares for triggering Target-of-Opportunity observations and would provide constraints on jet launching mechanisms.",12/4/2024,"['galactic', 'start_postsubscript', 'orbit', 'start_postsuperscript', 'powerlaw']"
Prospects for gamma-ray emission from magnetar regions in CTAO observations,"Recent multi-wavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions.

We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.",12/3/2024,"['supernova', 'interstellar', 'telescope', '2023', 'stellar']"
Nucleosynthesis Conditions in Outflows of White Dwarfs Collapsing to Neutron Stars,"Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (≳greater-than-or-equivalent-to\gtrsim≳ 5 s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, serving as a temporary benchmark for more comprehensive future studies.",12/3/2024,"['white dwarfs – stars: neutron – supernovae: general – neutrinos – hydrodynamics – nuclear reactions', ' nucleosynthesis', ' abundances']"
Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Propertiesin Collapsing Stellar Cores,"We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.",12/3/2024,"['supernova', 'physics', 'neutrino', 'explosions', 'neutron']"
Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State,"Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling.The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era.We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions.Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.",12/4/2024,"['neutron', 'gravitational', 'intensive', 'stars', 'increased']"
Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB). We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gaussian-Bonnet coupling constant α𝛼\alphaitalic_α within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative α𝛼\alphaitalic_α, and an increase for positive α𝛼\alphaitalic_α. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of constant α𝛼\alphaitalic_α to observe its impact on these properties.",12/4/2024,"['neutron', 'astrophysical', 'einstein', 'hyperons', 'quark']"

Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.",12/4/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'magnetic', 'protons', 'magnetars']"
Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution.Homogeneous medium.,"Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering large flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino refraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino mass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast instabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way as turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this framework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely homogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution.

Late-time HST and JWST Observations of GRB 221009A: Evidence for a Break in the Light Curve at 50 Days,"GRB 221009A is one of the brightest transients ever observed with the highest peak gamma-ray flux for a gamma-ray burst (GRB).

Detection of a new GeV source in the outer region of the Coma cluster: a signature of external accretion shock ?,"The supersonic flow motionsassociated with infall of baryonic gas toward sheets andfilaments, as well as cluster mergers, produces large-scale shock waves. The shocks associated with galaxy clusters can be classified mainly intotwo categories: internal shocks appear in the hotintracluster medium within the viral radius, and external accretion shocksform in the outer cold region well outside of the virial radius. Cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and/or protons accelerated by these shocks are expected to produce gamma-rays through inverse-Compton scatterings (ICS) or inelastic p⁢p𝑝𝑝ppitalic_p italic_p collisions respectively. Recent studies have found a spatially extended GeV source within the virial radius, consistent with the internal shock origin.Here we report the detection of a new GeV source at a distance of about 2.8∘ from the center of the Coma cluster through the analysis of 16.2 years of Fermi-LAT data. The hard spectrum of the source, in agreement with the ICS origin, and its location in a large-scale filament of galaxies points to the external accretion shock origin.

Probing jet dynamics and collimation in radio galaxies,"Context. Radio galaxies with visible two-sided jet structures, such as NGC 1052, are sources of particular interest to study the collimation and shock structure of active galactic nuclei jets. High-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry observations of such sources can resolve and study the jet collimation profile and probe different physical mechanisms. Aims. In this paper, we study the physics of double-sided radio sources at parsec scales, and in particular investigate whether propagating shocks can give rise to the observed asymmetry between jet and counterjet. Methods. We carry out special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and perform radiative transfer calculations of an over-pressured perturbed jet. During the radiative transfer calculations we incorporate both thermal and nonthermal emission while taking the finite speed of light into account. To further compare our results to observations, we create more realistic synthetic data including the properties of the observing array as well as the image reconstruction via multifrequency regularized maximum likelihood methods. We finally introduce a semi-automatized method for tracking jet components and extracting jet kinematics. Results. We show that propagating shocks in an inherently symmetric double-sided jet can lead to partially asymmetric jet collimation profiles due to time delay effects and relativistic beaming. These asymmetries may appear on specific epochs, with one jet evolving near conically and the other one parabolically (width profile evolving with a slope of ≈1absent1\approx 1≈ 1 and ≈0.5absent0.5\approx 0.5≈ 0.5, respectively). However, these spurious asymmetries are not significant when observing the source evolve for an extended amount of time.Conclusions. Purely observational effects are not enough to explain a persisting asymmetry in the jet collimation profile of double-sided jet sources and hint at evidence for asymmetrically launched jets.",12/3/2024,"['physics', 'galaxies', 'interferometry', 'ngc', 'galactic']"

Bayesian approach to equipartition estimation of magnetic field strength,"Magnetic fields, together with cosmic rays (CRs), play an important role in the dynamics and evolution of galaxies, but are difficult to estimate. Energy equipartition between magnetic fields and CRs provides a convenient way to approximate magnetic field strength from radio observations. We present a new approach for calculating the equipartition magnetic field strength based on Bayesian methods. In this approach, the magnetic field is a random variable that is distributed according to a posterior distribution conditional on synchrotron emission and the size of the emitting region. It allows the direct application of the general formulas for total and polarized synchrotron radiation without the need to invert these formulas, which has limited the equipartition method to highly simplified cases. We have derived the equipartition condition for the case of different low-energy breaks, slopes, and high-energy cutoffs of power law spectra of the CR proton and electron distributions. The derived formalism was applied in the general case of a magnetic field consisting of both uniform and randomly oriented field components. The applied Bayesian approach naturally provides the uncertainties in the estimated magnetic field strengths resulting from the uncertainties in the observables and the assumed values of the unknown physical parameters. In the examples presented, we used two different Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate the posterior distribution of the magnetic field. We have also developed a web application called BMAG that implements the described approach for different models and observational parameters of real sources.",12/4/2024,"['Galaxy magnetic fields (604)', ' Magnetic fields (994)', ' Radio astronomy (1338)', ' Supernova remnants (1667)', ' Cosmic rays (329)', ' Radio continuum emission (1340)', ' Bayesian statistics (1900)', ' Bayes’ Theorem (1924)']"

Extreme Deconvolution Reimagined: Conditional Densities via Neural Networks and an Application in Quasar Classification,"Density estimation is a fundamental problem that arises in many areas of astronomy, with applications ranging from selecting quasars using color distributions to characterizing stellar abundances. Astronomical observations are inevitably noisy; however, the density of a noise-free feature is often the desired outcome. The extreme-deconvolution (XD) method can be used to deconvolve the noise and obtain noise-free density estimates by fitting a mixture of Gaussians to data where each sample has non-identical (heteroscedastic) Gaussian noise. However, XD does not generalize to cases where some feature dimensions have highly non-Gaussian distribution, and no established method exists to overcome this limitation. We introduce a possible solution using neural networks to perform Gaussian mixture modeling of the Gaussian-like dimensions conditioned on those non-Gaussian features. The result is the CondXD algorithm, a generalization of XD that performs noise-free conditional density estimation. We apply CondXD to a toy model and find that it is more accurate than other approaches. We further test our method on a real-world high redshift quasar versus contaminant classification problem. Specifically, we estimate noise-free densities in flux-ratio (i.e., color) space for contaminants, conditioned on their magnitude. Our results are comparable to the existing method, which divides the samples into magnitude bins and applies XD separately in each bin, and our method is approximately ten times faster. Overall, our method has the potential to significantly improve estimating conditional densities and enable new discoveries in astronomy.",12/4/2024,"['astronomy', 'astronomical', 'noisy', 'quasars', 'contaminant']"

The algorithm reconstructs the complete Fourier map up to the maximum observed baseline length based entirely on the data without tuning by a user or training on prior images and reproduces images with high fidelity. KRISP works efficiently for many sparse array configurations even in the presence of significant image structure as long as the typical baseline separation is comparable to or less than the correlation length of the Fourier map, which is inversely proportional to the size of the target image.",12/2/2024,"['algorithm', 'interferometric', 'reconstructing', 'reconstructs', 'imaging']"
Advancing Black Hole Imaging with Space-Based Interferometry,"Horizon-scale imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has provided transformative insights into supermassive black holes but its resolution and scope are limited by ground-based constraints such as the size of the Earth, its relatively slow rotation, and atmospheric delays. Space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers the capability for studying a larger and more diverse sample of black holes. We identify a number of nearby supermassive black holes as prime candidates for horizon-scale imaging at millimeter wavelengths, and use source characteristics such as angular size, sky distribution, and variability timescales to shape the design of a space-based array. We identify specific metrics that serve as key predictors of image fidelity and scientific potential, providing a quantitative basis for optimizing mission design parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal configuration requires two space-based elements in high Earth orbits (HEO) that are not coplanar and are apparently counter-rotating. Our results delineate the key requirements for a space-based VLBI mission, enabling detailed studies of black hole shadows, plasma dynamics, and jet formation, advancing black hole astrophysics beyond the current capabilities of the EHT.",12/2/2024,['Black Holes (162) — High Energy Astrophysics (739) — Space Telescopes (1547) — Very Long Baseline Interferometry (1769)']
Performance of Photometric Template Fitting for Ultra-High Redshift Galaxies,"JWST has allowed the discovery of a significant population of galaxies at z>10𝑧10z>10italic_z > 10. Our understanding of the astrophysical properties of these galaxies relies on fitting templates developed using models predicting the differences between these first galaxies and lower-redshift counterparts. In this work, tests are performed on several of these high-redshift template sets in order to determine how successful they are at predicting both photometric redshifts and full spectroscopic energy distributions (SEDs). It is shown that the best templates for photometric redshift estimation differ from the best templates for predicting the full SED. Overall, some templates perform adequately at photometric redshift estimation, while all are generally poor predictors of the full SED, with a few objects in particular poorly fit by all template sets tested. We conclude that although photometric redshifts can be reliable, given high enough observational depth and adequate filters, models are not yet able to produce robust astrophysical properties for these ultra-high redshift galaxies.",12/2/2024,"['astrophysical', 'galaxies', '10italic_z', 'spectroscopic', 'photometric']"
"In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence through the Dyson Sphere-like structures around the Primordial Black Holes111This work is dedicated to Sohrab Rahvar, whom we admire for first teaching us about life in the Universe.","Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding the simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize the advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson spheres-like structures around primordial black holes in the Milky Way and other galaxies.",12/3/2024,"['Astrobiology (74) (catalog )', 'Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (2127) (catalog )', '  Primordial black holes (1292) (catalog )']"
Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods,"Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.",12/3/2024,"['billions', 'millions', 'quadrillions', 'thousands', 'quadrature']"
First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter,"We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations.We find that for an ALDM density of ρ0=0.4⁢GeV/cm3subscript𝜌00.4GeVsuperscriptcm3\rho_{0}=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^{3}italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.4 GeV / cm start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely ≲10−13.5−10−12.2⁢GeV−1less-than-or-similar-toabsentsuperscript1013.5superscript1012.2superscriptGeV1\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{}{\rm GeV}^{-1}≲ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 13.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 12.2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_GeV start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, for the mass range of 10−22−10−21⁢eVsuperscript1022superscript1021eV10^{-22}-10^{-21}~{}{\rm eV}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 22 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 21 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_eV.

Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables,"Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial informationabout the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs).However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after thediscovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significantuncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using theKanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates theclass probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It thenselects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on themutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operatedthe system for ∼300similar-toabsent300\sim 300∼ 300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automatedobservations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event.In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapiddeepening of the absorption component of the Hα𝛼\alphaitalic_α line.

Observations were conducted over an extended period, spanning from 2012 to 2024, covering a total of 50 photometric nights. Photometric measurements were used to find the standard transformation relations of the T100 photometric system. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, zero points and transformation coefficients of each night were determined. No time dependence was found for the secondary extinction coefficients. However, it was observed that the primary extinction coefficients decreased until the year 2019 and increased after that year. Strong seasonal variations in the extinction coefficients were not evident. Small differences in seasonal median values of them were used to attempt to find the atmospheric extinction sources.

Subsweep: Extensions to the sweep method for radiative transfer,"We introduce the radiative transfer postprocessing code Subsweep.The code is based on the method of transport sweeps, in which the exact solution to the scattering-less radiative transfer equation is computed in a single pass through the entire computational grid. The radiative transfer module is coupled to radiation chemistry, and chemical compositions as well as temperatures of the cells are evolved according to photon fluxes computed during radiative transfer. Subsweep extends the method of transport sweeps by incorporating sub-timesteps in a hierarchy of partial sweeps of the grid. This alleviates the need for a low, global timestep and as a result Subsweep is able to drastically reduce the amount of computation required for accurate integration of the coupled radiation chemistry equations. We succesfully apply the code to a number of physical tests such as the expansion of HII regions, the formation of shadows behind dense objects, and its behavior in the presence of periodic boundary conditions.",12/1/2024,['Key Words.: radiative transfer – methods: numerical – (ISM:) HII regions']

Uncovering the Effects of Array Mutual Coupling in 21-cm Experiments with the SKA-Low Radio Telescope,"We investigate the impact of Mutual Coupling (MC) between antennas on the time-delay power spectrum response of the core of the SKA-Low radio telescope. Using two in-house tools - Fast Array Simulation Tool (FAST) (a fast full-wave electromagnetic solver) and OSKAR (a GPU-accelerated radio telescope simulator) - we simulate station beams and compute visibilities for various array layouts (regular, sunflower, and random). Simulations are conducted in an Epoch of Reionisation subband between 120–150 MHz, with a fine frequency resolution of 100 kHz, enabling the investigation of late delays. Our results show that MC effects significantly increase foreground leakage into longer delays, especially for regular station layouts.

This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known).

Temporal-spatial distribution of YSOs nearby Taurus region,"The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs (≤\leq≤5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region.

Latitude Quenching Nonlinearity in the Solar Dynamo,"We compare two candidate nonlinearities for regulating the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton paradigm: tilt quenching (whereby the tilt of active regions is reduced in stronger cycles) and latitude quenching (whereby flux emerges at higher latitudes in stronger solar cycles). Digitized historical observations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions from 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca II K synoptic maps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot measurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but much stronger evidence for latitude-quenching. Further, we use proxy observations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface flux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit is obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference model where all polarities are filled using Hale’s Law. The optimization suggests clearly that the “dynamo effectivity range” of the Sun during this period should be less than 10∘superscript1010^{\circ}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT; this is also consistent with latitude quenching being dominant over tilt quenching.",12/3/2024,['Solar magnetic fields (1503) — Solar dynamo (2001) — Solar cycle (1487)']

An upper limit on the frequency of short-period black hole companions to Sun-like stars,"Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions.However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude.The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries.We present a search for close black hole companions (separation ≲20⁢R⊙less-than-or-similar-toabsent20subscript𝑅direct-product\lesssim 20R_{\odot}≲ 20 italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries.

The hidden magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament revealed by the injected flare material,"Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas.

An unbiased statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy,"Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z≤0.02𝑧0.02z\leq 0.02italic_z ≤ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4–8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.",12/3/2024,"['supernova', 'galaxies', 'explosions', 'massive', 'stars']"

The Newly Discovered Nova Super-Remnant Surrounding Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis: Will it Light Up During the Coming Eruption?,"A century or less separates the thermonuclear-powered eruptions of recurrent novae in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of massive white dwarfs. The colliding ejecta of successive recurrent nova events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once-in ∼similar-to\sim∼80-year recurrent nova event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millenia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [OIII] images, a ∼similar-to\sim∼ 30-parsec-diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Hα𝛼\alphaitalic_α, [NII] and [SII] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically-thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will not be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in pre-eruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution. While we cannot predict the morphology or intensity of dust-induced continuum light echoes following the coming flash, we encourage multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging as well as James Webb Space Telescope infrared imaging of T CrB during the year after it erupts.",12/2/2024,['binaries:close —Cataclysmic variables — stars:novae — stars:winds and outflows']
Modeling High Mass X-ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution,"We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass (8−20⁢M⊙820subscript𝑀direct-product8-20\,M_{\odot}8 - 20 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) donor stars and a 1.4⁢M⊙1.4subscript𝑀direct-product1.4\,M_{\odot}1.4 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutron star.

Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultra-stripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations.

Interfacial and density fluctuations in a lattice model of motility-induced phase separation,"We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.",12/5/2024,"['geometries', 'bubbles', 'capillary', 'curvature', 'laplace']"
PDMD: Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics for Variable-sized Water Clusters (H2O)n≤21𝑛21n\leq 21italic_n ≤ 21,"Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches, such as ab initio MD and empirical force field MD, face significant trade-offs between physical accuracy and computational efficiency. This work presents a novel Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics (PDMD) framework for predicting system energy and atomic forces of variable-sized water clusters (H2O)n≤21𝑛21n\leq 21italic_n ≤ 21. Specifically,PDMD employs the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to generate high-dimensional, equivariant features before leveraging ChemGNN, a graph neural network model that adaptively learns the atomic chemical environments without requiring a priori knowledge.Through an iterative self-consistent training approach, the converged PDMD achieves a mean absolute error of 7.1 meV/atom for energy and 59.8 meV/Å for forces, outperforming the state-of-the-art DeepMD by ∼similar-to\sim∼80% in energy accuracy and ∼similar-to\sim∼200% in force prediction. As a result, PDMD can reproduce the ab initio MD properties of water clusters at a tiny fraction of its computational cost.

Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal,"Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.",12/5/2024,"['crystals', 'ferromagnetic', 'crystal', 'simulations', 'unexpected']"
Spinon Singlet in Quantum Colored String: Origin of d𝑑ditalic_d-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe,"Although both experimental observations and numerical simulations have reached a consensus that the stripe phase is intertwined with superconductivity in cuprates, the microscopic mechanism behind d𝑑ditalic_d-wave pairing in the presence of stripes remains unclear.Using the effective theory of quantum colored strings, we derive the wavefunction in Fock space.Our results show that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to pair into a spinon singlet, which in turn facilitates the formation of negative pair-pair correlations between distant x𝑥xitalic_x-bonds and y𝑦yitalic_y-bonds, a hallmark of the d𝑑ditalic_d-wave pairing pattern.The same pair-pair correlation pattern is observed across various models, as confirmed by large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations.Based on these results, we conclude that the spinon singlet is the origin of d𝑑ditalic_d-wave superconductivity in a fluctuating, partially-filled stripe, and this mechanism may also extend to multi-stripe configurations.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'wavefunction', 'superconductivity', 'renormalization', 'simulations']"

The spin-phonon relaxation mechanism of single-molecule magnets in the presence of strong exchange coupling,"Magnetic relaxation in coordination compounds is largely dominated by the interaction of the spin with phonons. Large zero-field splitting and exchange coupling values have been empirically found to strongly suppress spin relaxation and have been used as the main guideline for designing new molecular compounds. Although a comprehensive understanding of spin-phonon relaxation has been achieved for mononuclear complexes, only a qualitative picture is available for polynuclear compounds. Here we fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a full first-principle description of spin-phonon relaxation in an air-stable Co(II) dimer with both large single-ion anisotropy and exchange coupling. Simulations reproduce the experimental relaxation data with excellent accuracy and provide a microscopic understanding of Orbach and Raman relaxation pathways and their dependency on exchange coupling, zero-field splitting, and molecular vibrations. Theory and numerical simulations show that increasing cluster nuclearity to just four cobalt units would lead to a complete suppression of Raman relaxation. These results hold a general validity for single-molecule magnets, providing a deeper understanding of their relaxation and revised strategies for their improvement.",12/5/2024,"['nuclearity', 'molecular', 'magnets', 'magnetic', 'simulations']"
Fractionalized Magnetization Plateaus in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice Material Er2Be2GeO7,"The experimental study of magnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has been ongoing for more than two decades, following the discovery of the first Shastry-Sutherland lattice materials SrCu2(BO3)2. However, the study of Shastry-Sutherland systems is often complicated by the requirements of high magnetic fields (>>> 20 T SrCu2(BO3)2) or the presence of itinerate electrons (e.g. REB4). In this paper, we present the magnetic properties of the Shastry-Sutherland lattice material Er2Be2GeO7. Like SrCu2(BO3)2, Er2Be2GeO7 exhibits fractionalized magnetization plateaus.

Bloch Oscillations of a Soliton in a 1D Quantum Fluid,"The motion of a quantum system subjected to an external force often defeats our classical intuition. A celebrated example is the dynamics of a single particle in a periodic potential, which undergoes Bloch oscillations under the action of a constant force [1, 2]. Surprisingly, Bloch-like oscillations can also occur in one-dimensional quantum fluids without requiring the presence of a lattice [3, 4]. The intriguing generalization of Bloch oscillations to a weakly-bounded ensemble of interacting particles has been so far limited to the experimental study of the two-particle case, where the observed period is halved compared to the single-particle case [5, 6]. In this work, we observe the oscillations of the position of a mesoscopic solitonic wave packet, consisting of approximately 1000 atoms in a one-dimensional Bose gas when subjected to a constant uniform force and in the absence of a lattice potential. The oscillation period scales inversely with the atom number, thus revealing its collective nature. We demonstrate the pivotal role of the phase coherence of the quantum bath in which the wave packet moves and investigate the underlying topology of the associated superfluid currents. Our measurements highlight the periodicity of the dispersion relation of collective excitations in one-dimensional quantum systems. We anticipate that our observation of such a macroscopic quantum phenomenon will inspire further studies on the crossover between classical and quantum laws of motion, such as exploring the role of dissipation, similarly to the textbook case of macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson physics [7].",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'quantum', 'dissipation', 'mesoscopic', 'experimental']"
Emergent Weyl-like points in periodically modulated systems and Floquet engineering,"We investigate a three-dimensional topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics.

The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Additionally, we compute the layer-resolved Floquet Hall conductivity and demonstrate that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be controlled via high-frequency laser pumping.",12/5/2024,"['topology', 'start_postsubscript', 'end_postsubscript', 'fermi', 'laser']"
Anomalous spectrum in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain,"The spectra of particles in disordered lattices can either be completely extended or localized or can be intermediate which hosts both the localized and extended states separated from each other. In this work, however, we show that in the case of a one dimensional lattice with long-range hopping and non-Hermitian quasiperiodic onsite potential, the localized and extended states in the spectrum are intermixed with each other rather than well separated.As a result, an atypical intermediate phase appears where consecutive pairs of extended states intermittently appear in the pool of localized states.We also argue that such anomalous spectral intermixing can be realized in the short-range hopping limit by appropriate engineering of the onsite potential. Moreover, we obtain that the nature of the spectrum also reveals non-standard scenarios in the complex energy plane where the complex energies encircle real ones.These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between the non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodic disorder in the system.",12/5/2024,"['spectral', 'lattices', 'anomalous', 'intermixing', 'disordered']"
Strange metal transport from coupling to fluctuating spins,"Metals hosting strong electronic interactions, including high-temperature superconductors, behave in ways that do not conform to the normal Fermi liquid theory.To pinpoint the microscopic origin of this ”strange metal” behavior, here we reexamine the transport and optical properties of the two-dimensional t-J model taking advantage of recent improvements made on the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), enabling numerically exact calculations at unprecedentedly low temperatures and high spectral resolution. We find that strange metallicityis pervasive in the temperature-doping phase diagram wherever magnetic order is suppressed: it is driven by thepresence of a fluctuating spin background,and it is therefore independent on hole concentration and unrelated to quantum criticality.Our results point to a two-step transport mechanism, with short- and long-time processes associated respectively with the charge and spin dynamics, the latter being responsible for both the strange metal character and the unconventional optical conductivities seen in experiments.",12/5/2024,"['fermi', 'metallicityis', 'superconductors', 'quantum', 'metal']"
Microscopic theory of displacive ferroelectricity: applications to quantum criticality and classical phase transitions,"Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO3 and KTaO3 as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO3 demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'ferroelectricity', 'ferroelectric', 'dielectric', 'science']"
Ternary Stochastic Neuron – Implemented with a Single Strained Magnetostrictive Nanomagnet,"Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties – “binary” where the neuronal state varies randomly between two values of ±plus-or-minus\pm±1 and ”analog” where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n𝑛nitalic_n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set.

Exceptionally strong double-layer barriers generated by polyampholyte salt,"Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have found anomalously long-ranged interactions between chargedsurfaces in concentrated saltsolutions. Ion clustering have been suggested as a possible origin of this behaviour.In this work, we demonstrate that if such stable clusters indeed form, they are able to induce remarkablystrong free energy barriers, under conditions where a corresponding solution of simple saltprovide negligible forces. Our cluster model is based on connected ions producing a polyampholyte salt, containinga symmetric mixture of monovalent cationic and anionic polyampholytes.Ion distributions and surface interactions are evaluated utilisingstatistical-mechanical (classical) polymer Density Functional Theory, cDFT.In the Supporting Information, we briefly investigate a range of different polymer architectures (connectivities), but in the main part of thework a polyampholyte ion is modelled as a linear chain with alternating charges, in which theends carry an identical charge (hence, a monovalent net charge).These salts are able to generate repulsions, between similarly charged surfaces, of a remarkable strength - exceedingthose from simple salts by orders of magnitude. The underlying mechanism for this is the formationof brush-like layers at the surfaces, i.e. the repulsion is strongly relatedto excluded volume effects, in a manner similar to the interaction between surfaces carrying grafted polymers.We believe our results are relevant not only to possible mechanisms underlyinganomalously long-ranged underscreening in concentrated simple salt solutions, but alsofor the potential use of synthesised polyampholyte salt as extremely efficient stabilisersof colloidal dispersions.",12/5/2024,"['chargedsurfaces', 'ions', 'polyampholytes', 'saltsolutions', 'polyampholyte']"
A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions,"Abstract:This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.",12/5/2024,"['fermionic', 'fermions', 'mechanics', 'fermion', 'linearities']"
Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPtxPd1-x,"Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L10 antiferromagnet MnPtxPd1-x. In thicker films, the AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and induces a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.",12/5/2024,"['magnetotransport', 'ferromagnets', 'magnetoresistance', 'antiferromagnetic', 'anisotropic']"
Diffusion caused by two noises - active and thermal,"The diffusion of colloids inside an active system - e.g.formulae-sequence𝑒𝑔e.g.italic_e . italic_g ., within a living cell or the dynamics of active particles itself (e.g.formulae-sequence𝑒𝑔e.g.italic_e . italic_g ., self-propelled particles) can be modeled through overdamped Langevin equation which contains an additional noise term apart from the usual white Gaussian noise, originating from the thermal environment. The second noise is referred to as “active noise”as it arises from activity such as chemical reactions. The probability distribution function (PDF or the propagator) in space-time along with moments provides essential information for understanding their dynamical behavior. Here we employ the phase-space path integral method to obtain the propagator, thereby moments and PDF for some possible models for such noise. At first, we discuss the diffusion of a free particle driven by active noise. We consider four different possible models for active noise, to capture the possible traits of such systems. We show that the PDF for systems driven by noises other than Gaussian noise largely deviates from normal distribution at short to intermediate time scales as a manifestation of out-of-equilibrium state, albeit converges to Gaussian distribution after a long time as a consequence of the central limit theorem. We extend our work to the case of a particle trapped in a harmonic potential and show that the system attains steady state at long time limit. Also, at short time scales, the nature of distribution is different for different noises, e.g.formulae-sequence𝑒𝑔e.g.italic_e . italic_g ., for particle driven by dichotomous noise, the probability is mostly concentrated near the boundaries whereas a long exponential tail is observed for a particle driven by Poissonian white noise.",12/5/2024,"['colloids', 'thermal', 'diffusion', 'chemical', 'cell']"
"GARFIELD, a toolkit for interpreting ultrafast electron diffraction data of imperfect quasi-single crystals","The analysis of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) data from low-symmetry single crystals of small molecules is often challenged by the difficulty of assigning unique Laue indices to the observed Bragg reflections. For a variety of technical and physical reasons, UED diffraction images are typically of lower quality when viewed from the perspective of structure determination by single-crystal X-ray or electron diffraction. Nevertheless, time series of UED images can provide valuable insight into structural dynamics, provided that an adequate interpretation of the diffraction patterns can be achieved. Garfield is a collection of tools with a graphical user interface designed to facilitate the interpretation of diffraction patterns and to index Bragg reflections in challenging cases where other indexing tools are ineffective. To this end, Garfield enables the user to interactively create, explore, and optimize sets of parameters that define the diffraction geometry and characteristic properties of the sample.",12/5/2024,"['diffraction', 'crystals', 'tools', 'challenging', 'insight']"
"Conformations, Dynamics, and Looping Kinetics of Partially Active Polymers","We investigate the conformational and dynamical properties of a partially active Rouse chain, where activity is localized within a specific segment, positioned at various locations along the chain and spanning any given length. Through analytical methods and simulations, we reveal how the location and size of the active segment influence polymer swelling patterns. Likewise, we observe that the mean squared distance between two points along the polymer, as well as the mean squared displacement of a tagged point, are notably affected by the local activity. In addition, the reconfiguration and looping dynamics show anomalous scaling behaviors, particularly in intermediate chain lengths, capturing the interplay between persistence of active motion and polymer relaxation dynamics. Our model, relevant to spatially varying activity observed in active biopolymeric systems, provides a basis for exploring more realistic models of chromatin behavior, especially those incorporating heterogeneous activity.",12/5/2024,"['reconfiguration', 'swelling', 'biopolymeric', 'polymer', 'chromatin']"
In-situ Investigation of the Phase Formation and Superconductivity in V3Si Thin Films at High Temperatures,"Vanadium silicide (V3Si) is a promising superconductor for integration with silicon-based electronics, however the interfacial growth kinetics have a strong influence on the resulting superconducting properties and are not yet fully understood. In this study, we have used neutron reflectometry to reveal the phase transformation during thin film growth driven by different annealing strategies. We examined the silicide formation when a thin layer of vanadium undergoes reactive diffusion with a silicon dioxide film on silicon at temperatures from 650–800 ∘C. To further investigate the time evolution of different phases under various annealing temperatures, a chemical model was developed and subsequent simulations were performed. The results of this model were validated using X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional TEM analysis. Correlations were observed between the structure and superconducting properties. Over-annealing films leads to complete depletion of the SiO2 barrier layer, forming diffuse interfaces and driving the formation of undesirable silicon-rich silicides. Avoiding this by controlling time and temperature, allows higher quality superconducting films to be achieved. The Tcsubscript𝑇𝑐T_{c}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of the films was found to be 13 K, and the annealing conditions influenced the critical fields and the paramagnetic Meissner effect near Tcsubscript𝑇𝑐T_{c}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

Dissipation-assisted preparation of topological boundary states,"Robust states emerging at the boundaries of a system are an important hallmark of topological matter. Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally realizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the steady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near the system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the parent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect stems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the topological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation. This work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge states, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.",12/5/2024,"['topological', 'insights', 'experimentally', 'hamiltonian', 'important']"
Restricted Boltzmann machine network versus Jastrow correlatedwave function for the two-dimensional Hubbard model,"We consider a restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) correlated BCS wave function as the ground stateof the two-dimensional Hubbard model and study its electronic and magnetic properties as a functionof hole doping. We compare the results with those obtained by using conventional Jastrow projectors.The results show that the RBM wave function outperforms the Jastrow projected ones inthe underdoped region in terms of the variational energy. Computation of superconducting (SC) correlationsin the model shows that the RBM wave function gives slightly weaker SC correlations as comparedto the Jastrow projected wave functions. A significant advantage of the RBM wave function is that it spontaneously gives rise to strong antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in the underdoped region even though the wave function does not incorporate any explicit AF order. In comparison, AF correlations in the Jastrow projected wave functions are found to be very weak. These and other results obtained show that theRBM wave function provides an improved description of the phase diagram of the model.The work also demonstrates the power of neural-network quantum state (NQS) wave functionsin the study of strongly correlated electron systems.",12/5/2024,"['antiferromagnetic', 'doping', 'boltzmann', 'quantum', 'electron']"
Entropy estimation for partially accessible Markov networks based on imperfect observations: Role of finite resolution and finite statistics,"Estimating entropy production from real observation data can be difficult due to finite resolution in both space and time and finite measurement statistics. We characterize the statistical error introduced by finite sample size and compare the performance of three different entropy estimators under these limitations for two different paradigmatic systems, a four-state Markov network and an augmented Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. We consider the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a waiting-time based estimator for resolved transitions and a waiting-time based estimator for blurred transitions in imperfect observation scenarios. For perfect measurement statistics and finite temporal resolution, the estimator based on resolved transitions performs best in all considered scenarios. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation gives a better estimate than the estimator based on blurred transitions at low driving affinities, whereas the latter performs better at high driving affinities. Furthermore, we find that a higher temporal and spatial resolution leads to slower convergence of measurement statistics, implying that for short measurement times, a lower resolution may be beneficial. Additionally, we identify a self-averaging effect for the waiting-time based entropy estimators that can reduce their variance for observations with finite statistics.",12/5/2024,"['thermodynamic', 'difficult', 'markov', 'uncertainty', 'entropy']"
Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor,"Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe2(As1-xPx)2, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of ∼similar-to\sim∼25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below TFM≈19subscript𝑇FM19T_{\mathrm{FM}}\approx 19italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_FM end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≈ 19 K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below TFMsubscript𝑇FMT_{\mathrm{FM}}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_FM end_POSTSUBSCRIPT we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.",12/5/2024,"['irreversibility', 'rare', 'stark', 'ferromagnetic', 'annihilation']"
Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases,"Technology involving hybrid superconductor–semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission.Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices.While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research.Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases.In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands.We start from the Luttinger–Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor–semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands.Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties.Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of s𝑠sitalic_s-wave and d𝑑ditalic_d-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin–orbit couplings.Our model thus presents a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.",12/5/2024,"['superconductivity', 'quantum', 'semiconductors', 'superconductor', 'superconducting']"

Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagomé Lattice,"The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagomé lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the Dirac semimetal phase is unstable against the many-particle interactions due to the intervalley scattering, which spontaneously breaks the translation symmetry. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagomé lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to the fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct ℤ6subscriptℤ6\mathbb{Z}_{6}blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.",12/5/2024,"['fermions', 'fermion', 'dirac', 'physics', 'dispersion']"
Orbital Optical Raman Lattice,"The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p𝑝pitalic_p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'quantum', 'supersolids', 'bosons', 'supersolid']"
Exciton thermalization dynamics in monolayer MoS2: a first-principles Boltzmann equation study,"Understanding exciton thermalization is critical for optimizing optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes in many materials. However, it is hard to access the dynamics of such processes experimentally, especially on systems such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where various low-energy excitations pathways can compete for exciton thermalization. Here, we study exciton dynamics due to exciton-phonon scattering in monolayer MoS2 from a first-principles, interacting Green’s function approach, to obtain the relaxation and thermalization of low-energy excitons following different initial excitations at different temperatures.We find that the thermalization occurs on a picosecond timescale at 300 K but can increase by an order of magnitude at 100 K.The long total thermalization time, owing to the nature of its excitonic band structure, is dominated by slow spin-flip scattering processes in monolayer MoS2.In contrast, thermalization of excitons in individual spin-aligned and spin-anti-aligned channels can be achieved within a few hundred fs when exciting higher-energy excitons.We further simulate the intensity spectrum of time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) experiments and anticipate that such calculations may serve as a map to correlate spectroscopic signatures with microscopic exciton dynamics.",12/5/2024,"['photocatalytic', 'optoelectronic', 'photoemission', 'spectroscopy', 'spectroscopic']"

Type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetal CrB4,"Dirac nodal line semimetals with topologically protected drumhead surface states have attracted intense theoretical and experimental attention over a decade. However, the study of type-II Dirac nodal line semimetals is rare, especially the type-II nodal chain semimetals have not been confirmed by experiment due to the lack of ideal material platform. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that CrB4 is an ideal type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetal protected by the mirror symmetry. Moreover, there are two nodal rings protected by both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries in CrB4. More importantly, in CrB4 the topologically protected drumhead surface states span the entire Brillouin zone at the Fermi level. On the other hand, the electron-hole compensation and the high mobility of Dirac fermions can result in large magnetoresistance effects in CrB4 according to the two-band model. Considering the fact that CrB4 has been synthesized experimentally and the spin-orbit coupling is very weak, CrB4 provides an ideal material platform for studying the exotic properties of type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetals in experiment.",12/5/2024,"['decade', 'fermi', 'rare', 'fermions', 'theoretical']"

Floquet-Bloch Valleytronics,"Driving quantum materials out-of-equilibrium makes it possible to generate states of matter inaccessible through standard equilibrium tuning methods [1, 2, 3]. Upon time-periodic coherent driving of electrons using electromagnetic fields, the emergence of Floquet-Bloch states enables the creation and control of exotic quantum phases [4, 5, 6, 7]. In transition metal dichalcogenides, broken inversion symmetry within each monolayer results in a non-zero Berry curvature at the K and K′ valley extrema, giving rise to chiroptical selection rules that are fundamental to valleytronics [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Here, we bridge the gap between these two concepts and introduce Floquet-Bloch valleytronics. Using time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy combined with state-of-the-art ab initio theory, we demonstrate the formation of valley-polarized Floquet-Bloch states in 2H-WSe2 upon below-bandgap coherent electron driving with chiral light pulses. We investigate quantum path interference between Floquet-Bloch and Volkov states [13, 14, 15, 16], showing that this interferometric process depends on the valley pseudospin and light polarization-state. Conducting extreme ultraviolet photoemission circular dichroism in these nonequilibrium settings reveals the potential for controlling the orbital character of Floquet-engineered states. These findings link Floquet engineering and quantum geometric light-matter coupling in two-dimensional materials. They can serve as a guideline for reaching novel out-of-equilibrium phases of matter by dynamically breaking symmetries through coherent dressing of winding Bloch electrons with tailored light pulses.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'electrons', 'chiroptical', 'electromagnetic', 'electron']"
Macroscopic arrow of time from multiscale perspectives,"Fundamental laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal (T𝑇Titalic_T) symmetry, but the T𝑇Titalic_T symmetry is strongly broken in the macroscopic world. In this Perspective, I review T𝑇Titalic_T symmetry breaking frameworks: second law of thermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer, and open systems. In driven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale energy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of time. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and energy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another important factor that breaks the T𝑇Titalic_T symmetry.",12/5/2024,"['thermodynamics', 'physics', 'turbulence', 'macroscopic', 'irreversible']"
Unified analysis of phase-field models for cohesive fracture,"Due to the great success achieved in the modeling of brittle fracture, the phase-field approach to cohesive fracture becomes popular. Despite the recent noteworthy contributions, a unified theoretical framework is lacking, imposing difficulty in selecting proper models and for further improvement. To this end, we address in this review unified analysis of phase-field models for cohesive fracture. Aiming to regularize the Barenblatt (1959) cohesive zone model, all the discussed models are distinguished by three characteristic functions, i.e., the geometric function dictating the crack profile, the degradation function for the constitutive relation and the dissipation function defining the crack driving force. The latter two functions coincide in the associated formulation, while in the non-associated one they are designed to be different. Distinct from the counterpart for brittle fracture, in the phase-field model for cohesive fracture the regularization length parameter has to be properly incorporated into the dissipation and/or degradation functions such that the failure strength and traction–separation softening curve are both well-defined. Moreover, the resulting crack bandwidth needs to be non-decreasing during failure in order that imposition of the crack irreversibility condition does not affect the anticipated traction–separation law (TSL). With a truncated degradation function that is proportional to the length parameter, the Conti et al. (2016) model and the latter improved versions can deal with crack nucleation only in the vanishing limit and capture cohesive fracture only with a particular TSL. Owing to a length scale dependent degradation function of rational fraction, these deficiencies are largely overcome in the phase-field cohesive zone model (PF-CZM). Among many variants in the literature, only with the optimal geometric function, can the associated PF-CZM apply to general non-concave softening laws and the non-associated PF-CZM to (almost) any arbitrary one. Some mis-interpretations are clarified and representative numerical examples are presented.",12/5/2024,"['popular', 'fracture', 'improved', 'cohesive', 'success']"
Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice with an Indefinite Long-Range Interaction,"Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactions in lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interaction matrices.We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive- and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageable sign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on large lattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interaction matrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition within the Gross-Neveu criticality class.Notably, the phase transition boundary aligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing new evidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship between phase transitions and the sign problem.",12/5/2024,"['fermions', 'quantum', 'matrices', 'simulations', 'honeycomb']"
Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects,"The nonuniform ℤ2subscriptℤ2\mathbb{Z}_{2}roman_ℤ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci.

Numerical Study of Disordered Noninteracting Chains Coupled to a Local Lindblad Bath,"Abstract:Disorder can prevent many-body quantum systems from reaching thermal equilibrium, leading to a many-body localized phase. Recent works suggest that nonperturbative effects caused by rare regions of low disorder may destabilize the localized phase. However, numerical simulations of interacting systems are generically possible only for small system sizes, where finite-size effects might dominate. Here we perform a numerical investigation of noninteracting disordered spin chains coupled to a local Lindblad bath at the boundary. Our results reveal strong finite-size effects in the Lindbladian gap in both bath-coupled Anderson and Aubry-André-Harper models, leading to a non-monotonic behavior with the system size. We discuss the relaxation properties of a simple toy model coupled to local Lindblad baths, connecting its features to those of noninteracting localized chains. We comment on the implications of our findings for many-body systems.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'simulations', 'disordered', 'disorder', 'destabilize']"
Mapping delocalization of impurity bands across archetypal Mott-Anderson transition,"Tailoring charge transport in solids on demand is the overarching goal of condensed-matter research as it is crucial for electronic applications. Yet, often the proper tuning knob is missing and extrinsic factors such as impurities and disorder impede coherent conduction.Here we control the very buildup of an electronic band from impurity states within the pseudogap of ternary \ceFe_2–xV_1+xAl Heusler compounds via reducing the Fe content. Our density functional theory calculations combined with specific heat and electrical resistivity experiments reveal that, initially, these states are Anderson-localized at low V concentrations 0<x<0.10𝑥0.10<x<0.10 < italic_x < 0.1. As x𝑥xitalic_x increases, we monitor the formation of mobility edges upon the archetypal Mott-Anderson transition and map the increasing bandwidth of conducting states by thermoelectric measurements.

Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large p𝑝pitalic_p-asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a ‘soft’ version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure.

Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state,"Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.",12/3/2024,"['asymptotics', 'electrons', 'vanishing', 'electron', 'quantum']"

Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution,"Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales [Di Bari et al., PNAS 121, e2406807121 (2024)].In analogy with other disordered systems,this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlationsbetween mutationshappening at distinct sites and times.To quantify these correlations,we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape.By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths.Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales.This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction.We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods.At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively.To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.",12/2/2024,"['mutations', 'e2406807121', 'mutationshappening', 'protein', 'physics']"
Disordered topological crystalline phases,"The imposition of crystalline symmetries is known to lead to a rich variety of insulating and superconducting topological phases. These include higher-order topological phases and obstructed atomic limits with and without filling anomalies. We here comprehensively classify such topological crystalline phases (TCPs) with mirror, twofold rotation, and inversion symmetries in the presence of disorder that preserves the crystalline symmetry on average. We find that the inclusion of disorder leads to a simplification of the classification in comparison to the clean case. We also find that, while clean TCPs evade a general bulk-boundary principle, disordered TCPs admit a complete bulk-boundary correspondence, according to which (bulk) topological phases are topologically equivalent if and only if they have the same anomalous boundary states and filling anomaly. We corroborate the stability of disordered TCPs by way of field-theoretic, numerical and symmetry-based analyses in various case studies. While the boundary signatures of most disordered TCPs are similar to their clean counterparts, the addition of disorder to certain mirror-symmetric TCPs results in novel higher-order statistical topological phases, in which zero-energy hinge states have critical wavefunction statistics, while remaining protected from Anderson localization.",12/2/2024,"['topologically', 'topological', 'symmetries', 'superconducting', 'simplification']"
Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems,"Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and Rényi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.",11/29/2024,"['quantum', 'insights', 'scrambling', 'lindblad', 'explored']"
Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography,"The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below 𝟐𝒌superscript2𝒌\bm{2^{k}}bold_2 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bold_italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size ∼𝒌similar-toabsent𝒌\sim\bm{k}∼ bold_italic_k remains a challenge.

The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.",11/28/2024,"['quantum', 'tomography', 'rapid', 'start_postsuperscript', 'exponential']"
Diffusion in liquid metals is directed by competing collective modes,"The self-diffusion process in a dense liquid is influenced by collective particle movements.Extensive molecular dynamics simulations for liquid aluminium and rubidium evidence a crossover in the diffusion coefficient at about 1.41.41.41.4 times the melting temperature Tmsubscript𝑇𝑚T_{m}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, indicating a profound change in the diffusion mechanism.The corresponding velocity auto-correlation functions demonstrate a decrease of the cage effect with a gradual set-in of a power-law decay, the celebrate long time tail.

Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems,"Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder.

Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure—a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables—enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naïve method.

Task learning through stimulation-induced plasticity in neural networks,"Synaptic plasticity dynamically shapes the connectivity of neural systems and is key to learning processes in the brain. To what extent the mechanisms of plasticity can be exploited to drive a neural network and make it perform some kind of computational task remains unclear. This question, relevant in a bioengineering context, can be formulated as a control problem on a high-dimensional system with strongly constrained and non-linear dynamics. We present a self-contained procedure which, through appropriate spatio-temporal stimulations of the neurons, is able to drive rate-based neural networks with arbitrary initial connectivity towards a desired functional state. We illustrate our approach on two different computational tasks: a non-linear association between multiple input stimulations and activity patterns (representing digit images), and the construction of a continuous attractor encoding a collective variable in a neural population.

Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network,"We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of N𝑁Nitalic_N electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing.

"Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials","Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) or atom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lack chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and the computational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fully achieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of both approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and force field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structural descriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feed forward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquid \ceCO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide a new route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.",11/30/2024,"['chemically', 'atomistic', 'neural', 'polynomial', 'quantum']"
Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Implications for Fragility,"We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph.

Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization.

Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics.In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes.The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current.",11/29/2024,"['physics', 'superconducting', 'inhomogeneities', 'renormalization', 'supercurrent']"
Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning,"Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network’s limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.",11/27/2024,"['transformers', 'learning', 'transformer', 'memorization', 'mechanistic']"
Rényi complexity in mean-field disordered systems,"Abstract:Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, Rényi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the Rényi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the Rényi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the Rényi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m>1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between Rényi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.",11/29/2024,"['physics', 'computational', 'theoretical', 'entropy', 'complexity']"

In general, it is unclear which of these two approaches is most suitable for a given problem. The choice is expected to depend on factors such as the availability of system knowledge, dataset size, desired accuracy, computational resources, and other considerations.

Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems,"In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our works highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.",11/29/2024,"['hermitian', 'eigenstates', 'hamiltonian', 'disordered', 'ballistic']"
Open and trapping channels in complex resonant media,"We present a statistical study of the transmission and dwell-time matrices in disordered media composed of resonators, focusing on how frequency detuning influences their eigenvalue distributions. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of transmission eigenvalues undergoes a transition from a monomodal to a bimodal profile, and back to monomodal, as the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the particles. Moreover, the distribution of dwell-time eigenvalues broadens significantly near resonance, with the longest lifetimes exceeding the median by several orders of magnitude. These results are explained by examining how frequency ω𝜔\omegaitalic_ω affects the transport mean free path of light, ℓ⁢(ω)ℓ𝜔\ell(\omega)roman_ℓ ( italic_ω ), and the energy transport velocity, vE⁢(ω)subscript𝑣𝐸𝜔v_{E}(\omega)italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_E end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_ω ), which in turn shape the observed distributions. We demonstrate the strong potential of wavefront shaping to enhance both transmission and energy storage in resonant disordered media.

Training the parametric interactions in an analog bosonic quantum neural network with Fock basis measurement,"Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights—a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Furthermore, we show that training significantly reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing.",11/28/2024,"['quantum', 'neural', 'neurons', 'trainable', 'computing']"
Nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on graphs,"We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on the definition of a probability distribution for infinite edge trajectories in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single d×d×r2𝑑𝑑superscript𝑟2d\times d\times r^{2}italic_d × italic_d × italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT tensor, where r𝑟ritalic_r is the number of states per variable and d𝑑ditalic_d is the matrix-product bond dimension.

Even for small d𝑑ditalic_d, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method gives access to accurate temporal correlations which, in some regimes, may be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.",11/28/2024,"['graphs', 'markov', 'start_postsuperscript', 'end_postsuperscript', 'matrix']"
Planckian Diffusion: The Ghost of Anderson Localization,"We find that Anderson localization ceases to exist when a random medium begins to move, but another type of fundamental quantum effect, Planckian diffusion D=α⁢ℏ/m𝐷𝛼Planck-constant-over-2-pi𝑚D=\alpha\hbar/mitalic_D = italic_α roman_ℏ / italic_m, rises to replace it, with α𝛼\alphaitalic_α of order of unity.

Impact of local structure on melt dynamics in Cu-Ti alloys: Insights from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations,"First-principle based molecular-dynamics simulations have been performed for binary CuxTi1-x (x = 0.31, 0.50, and 0.76) alloys to investigate the relationship between local structure and dynamical properties in the liquid and undercooled melt. The undercooled melts show a pronounced short-range order, majorly a five-fold symmetry (FFS) around the Cu atoms, which competes with bcc ordering. This complex SRO is also reflected in the partial coordination numbers, where mainly a Z12 coordination is present around Cu, which corresponds to an icosahedral ordering. Higher coordination numbers were obtained for Ti compatible with Frank-Kasper polyhedra. The increasing Frank-Kasper polyhedra coordination scenario around Ti impacts on the interatomic distances of Ti atoms, which increase with increasing Ti content. The Cu50Ti50 composition exhibits the highest FFS ordering and amount of Frank-Kasper polyhedra, which explains the slowest melt dynamics, found experimentally and in simulations for this composition. Thus, our results suggest that the high undercooling degree and glass-forming ability of binary CuTi alloys, originates from the high complexity of the local structure rather than due to the preferred formation of Cu-Ti pairs, as Cu-Ti interactions were found to be weak.",12/4/2024,"['molecular', 'polyhedra', 'z12', 'interatomic', 'icosahedral']"
Ferroelectric domain walls for environmental sensors,"Domain walls in ferroelectric oxides provide fertile ground for the development of next-generation nanotechnology. Examples include domain-wall-based memory, memristors, and diodes, where the unusual electronic properties and the quasi-2D nature of the walls are leveraged to emulate the behavior of electronic components at ultra-small length scales. Here, we demonstrate atmosphere-related reversible changes in the electronic conduction at neutral ferroelectric domain walls in Er(Mn,Ti)O3. By exposing the system to reducing and oxidizing conditions, we drive the domain walls from insulating to conducting, and vice versa, translating the environmental changes into current signals. Density functional theory calculations show that the effect is predominately caused by charge carrier density modulations, which arise as oxygen interstitials accumulate at the domain walls. The work introduces an innovative concept for domain-wall-based environmental sensors, giving an additional dimension to the field of domain wall nanoelectronics and sensor technology in general.",12/4/2024,"['nanotechnology', 'nanoelectronics', 'ferroelectric', 'technology', 'innovative']"
The Role of Chalcogen Vacancies in Single Photon Emission from Monolayer Tungsten Dichalcogenides,"Understanding the mechanism of single photon emission (SPE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is an unsolved problem important for quantum optical materials and the development of quantum information applications. In 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as tungsten diselenide (WSe2subscriptWSe2\text{WSe}_{\text{2}}WSe start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), quantum emission has been broadly attributed to exciton localization from atomic point defects, yet the precise microscopic picture is not fully understood. This work presents a new framework, supported by both computational and experimental evidence, to explain both the origins of facile SPE in WSe2subscriptWSe2\text{WSe}_{\text{2}}WSe start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the relative scarcity of SPE in the related 2D TMD, tungsten disulfide (WS2subscriptWS2\text{WS}_{\text{2}}WS start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT). A vertical divacancy configuration of selenium creates a defect-centered, direct energy gap in the band structure of WSe2subscriptWSe2\text{WSe}_{\text{2}}WSe start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, giving rise to highly localized, radiative transitions. This configuration is shown to be energetically preferred in the monolayer lattice, which is reflected in the abundant experimental observation of SPE in WSe2subscriptWSe2\text{WSe}_{\text{2}}WSe start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT both from the literature and this work. In contrast, the same vertical divacancy configuration in WS2subscriptWS2\text{WS}_{\text{2}}WS start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT does not create direct localized transitions, consistent with scarce observations of SPE in that material. By revealing a single mechanism in tungsten-based TMDs that addresses the prevalence of SPE and is consistent between theory and experiment, these results provide a framework for better understanding the rules governing the atomic origins of single photon emission in TMDs.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'tungsten', 'experimental', 'scarcity', 'atomic']"
Performance-driven Computational Design of Multi-terminal Compositionally Graded Alloy Structures using Graphs,"The spatial control of material placement afforded by metal additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled significant progress in the development and implementation of compositionally graded alloys (CGAs) for spatial property variation in monolithic structures. However, cracking and brittle phase formation have hindered CGA development, with limited research extending beyond materials design to structural design. Notably, the high-dimensional alloy design space (systems with more than three active elements) remains poorly understood, specifically for CGAs. As a result, many prior efforts take a trial-and-error approach. Additionally, current structural design methods are inadequate for joining dissimilar alloys. In light of these challenges, recent work in graph information modeling and design automation has enabled topological partitioning and analysis of the alloy design space, automated design of multi-terminal CGAs, and automated conformal mapping of CGAs onto corresponding structural geometries. In comparison, prior gradient design approaches are limited to two-terminal CGAs. Here, we integrate these recent advancements, demonstrating a unified performance-driven CGA design approach on a gas turbine blade with broader application to other material systems and engineering structures.",12/4/2024,"['brittle', 'inadequate', 'hindered', 'poorly', 'dissimilar']"
Quantum Theory of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy,"Characterizing quantum materials is essential for understanding their microscopic interactions and advancing quantum technology. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with coherent X-ray sources offers access to higher-order correlations, but its theoretical basis, the Siegert relation, is derived from dynamical light scattering with independent classical scatterers, and its validity for XPCS remains unexamined. Here we present a microscopic quantum theory of XPCS derived from elecron-photon interaction Hamiltonians, introducing four configurations tied to distinct fourth-order electron-density correlation functions. We examine the validity of the Siegert relation and derive a generalized Siegert relation. Notably, the Siegert relation breaks down even in non-interacting Fermi gas due to exchange interactions. Furthermore, density matrix renormalization group calculations on 1D Kitaev chain reveal oscillatary signatures that can distinguish topologically trivial phases from topological phases with Majorana zero modes. Our work provides a robust theoretical foundation for XPCS and highlights the value of higher-order correlations in advanced X-ray and neutron sources for probing quantum materials.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'spectroscopy', 'theoretical', 'fermi', 'electron']"
Long-lived population inversion in resonantly driven excitonic antiferromagnet,"Van der Waals magnets are an emerging material family for investigating light-matter interactions and spin-correlated excitations.

The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We demonstrate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which spontaneous Hall effect is controlled by the chiral edge modes. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. We illustrate possible experiments to realize topologically altermagnetic responses according to the bulk–boundary correspondence.",12/4/2024,"['graphene', 'altermagnetism', 'altermagnetic', 'topologically', 'topological']"
Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility,"We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet—a metallic state with full spin polarization—arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics.We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility.Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state.In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the thermodynamic limit.We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples:doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal.Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.",12/4/2024,"['ferromagnetism', 'fermionic', 'ferromagnet', 'electrons', 'thermodynamic']"
Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals,"The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research.

In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.",12/4/2024,"['decades', '16358', 'algebraic', 'quantum', 'research']"
The morphology and interface structure of titanium on graphene,"Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.",12/4/2024,"['nanoelectronics', 'titanium', 'graphene', 'spectroscopy', 'metal']"

Magnetic properties and growth kinetics of Co/Gd bilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,"Ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) exhibit a range of intriguing magnetic phenomena, including all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS), fast current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM), and the potential to act as orbital-to-spin angular momentum converters. For spintronic applications involving these materials, the Curie temperature is a crucial factor in determining not only the threshold energy for AOS, but also the material’s resistance to temperature rise during CIDWM. However, the relationship between the Curie temperature, the thicknesses of the individual layers, and the specifics of the growth process remains an open question. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the Curie temperature of one of the archetype synthetic ferrimagnets with PMA, the Pt/Co/Gd trilayer, grown by DC magnetron sputtering and characterized with MOKE and SQUID. We provide an interpretation of the experiments we designed to address these outstanding questions through modeling of the deposition process and the induced magnetization at the Co/Gd interface. Our findings demonstrate that the Curie temperature and, by extension, the conditions for PMA and magnetic compensation, of these ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets are not only impacted by the interface quality, which can be influenced by the sputtering process, but also to a significant extent by finite-size effects in the 4f-material.

Ab-initio study of the beta Fe2O3 phase,"We present first-principles results on the electronic and magnetic properties of the cubic bulk β𝛽\betaitalic_β-phase of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Given that all Fe-Fe magnetic couplings are expected to be antiferromagnetic within this high-symmetry crystal structure, the system may exhibit some signature of magnetic frustration, making it challenging to identify its magnetic ground state.We have analyzed the possible magnetic phases of the β𝛽\betaitalic_β-phase among which there are ferrimagnets, altermagnets and Kramers antiferromagnets. While the α𝛼\alphaitalic_α-phase is an altermagnet and the γ𝛾\gammaitalic_γ-phase is a ferrimagnet, we conclude that the magnetic ground state for the bulk β𝛽\betaitalic_β-phase of Fe2O3 is a Kramers antiferromagnet, moreover, we find that close in energy there is a bulk d-wave altermagnetic phase. We report the density of states and the evolution band gap as a function of the electronic correlations, for suitable values of the Coulomb repulsion the system is a charge-transfer insulator with an indirect band gap of 1.5 eV. More in detail, the unit cell of the β𝛽\betaitalic_β-phase is composed of 8 Fea atoms and 24 Feb atoms. The 8 Fea atoms lie on the corner of a cube and their magnetic ground state is an G-type. This structural phase is composed of zig-zag chains Fea-Feb-Fea-Feb with spin configuration ↑↑\uparrow↑-↑↑\uparrow↑-↓↓\downarrow↓-↓↓\downarrow↓ along the 3 directions such that for every Fea atoms there are 3 Feb atoms. As the opposite to the γ𝛾\gammaitalic_γ-phase, the magnetic configuration between first-neighbor of the same kind is always antiferromagnetic while the magnetic configuration between Fea and Feb is ferro or antiferro. In this magnetic arrangement, first-neighbor interactions cancel out in the mean-field estimation of the Néel temperature, leaving second-neighbor magnetic exchanges as the primary contributors, resulting in a Néel temperature lower than that of other phases. Our work paves the way toward the ab initio study of nanoparticles and alloys for the β𝛽\betaitalic_β-phase of Fe2O3.",12/4/2024,"['ferrimagnets', 'nanoparticles', 'magnetic', 'iron', 'alloys']"
Persistent Spin Textures in Nonpolar Chiral Systems,"In this paper, we have proposed a novel route for the realisation of persistent spin texture (PST).

Evidence of spin-reorientation transition below 150 K from magnetic force microscopy in ferromagnetic BiFeO3 thin film,"We investigated the magnetic transitions in BiFeO3 at low temperature (5-300 K) and observed nearly 90o rotation of magnetic domains (imaged by vertical magnetic force microscopy) across 150 K in an epitaxial thin film of thickness ∼similar-to\sim∼36 nm. It offers a clear evidence of spin-reorientation transition. It also corroborates the transition observed below ∼similar-to\sim∼150 K in the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature data. The field-driven 180o domain switching at room temperature, on the other hand, signifies presence of ferromagnetism. Since bulk antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 does not exhibit such a transition, this observation in ferromagnetic thin film of BiFeO3 indicates a radical effect because of epitaxial strain.

Fast and stable tight-binding framework for nonlocal kinetic energy density functional reconstruction in orbital-free density functional calculations,"Nonlocal kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) with density-dependent kernels are currently the most accurate functionals available for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) calculations. However, despite advances in numerical techniques and using only (semi)local density-dependent kernels, nonlocal KEDFs still present substantial computational costs in OF-DFT, limiting their application in large-scale material simulations. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient framework for reconstructing nonlocal KEDFs by incorporating the density functional tight-binding approach, in which the energy functionals are simplified through a first-order functional expansion based on the superposition of free-atom electron densities. This strategy allows the computationally expensive nonlocal kinetic energy and potential calculations to be performed only once during the electron density optimization process, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Benchmark tests using advanced nonlocal KEDFs, such as revHC and LDAK-MGPA, on standard structures including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Si, III-V semiconductors, as well as Mg50 and Si50 clusters, demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, providing a cost-effective balance between accuracy and computational speed. Additionally, the reconstructed functionals exhibit improved numerical stability for both bulk and finite systems, paving the way for developing more sophisticated KEDFs for realistic material simulations using OF-DFT.",12/4/2024,"['expensive', 'efficient', 'computationally', 'optimization', 'accurate']"
CuXASNet: Rapid and Accurate Prediction of Copper L𝐿Litalic_L-edge X-Ray Absorption Spectra Using Machine Learning,"In this work, we have developed CuXASNet, a dense neural network that predicts simulated Cu L𝐿Litalic_L-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) from atomic structures. Featurization of the Cu local environment is performed using a component of M3GNet, a graph neural network developed for predicting the potential energy surface. CuXASNet is trained on simulated spectra from FEFF9 at the multiple scattering level of theory, and can predict the L3subscript𝐿3L_{3}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT edges for Cu sites to quantitative accuracy. To validate our approach, we compare 14 experimental spectra extracted from the literature with the predictions of CuXASNet.

As such, CuXASNet can rapidly generate a large number of L𝐿Litalic_L-edge XAS spectra at the same accuracy as FEFF9 simulations. This can be used as a drop-in replacement for multiple scattering codes for fast screening of candidate atomic structure models of a measured system.

Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal–Organic Frameworks,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.",12/3/2024,"['porous', 'thermoelectrics', 'challenging', 'metal', 'atomistic']"
Density of states and differential entropy in the Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields,"The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons ingraphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison,the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons incrossed magnetic and electric fields.The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering.In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in grapheneare examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau statecounting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a field-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor.Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface modelocalized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.",12/4/2024,"['graphene', 'grapheneare', 'electrons', 'calculations', 'dirac']"
Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal Invariant Materials,"We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials displaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations for traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that resemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime relevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays a Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and forth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses the material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of polarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the intensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring thickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower frequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials displaying the non-linear Hall effect.",12/4/2024,"['electromagnetic', 'radiation', 'boltzmann', 'faraday', 'oscillation']"
Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator,"The prospect of developing more efficient classical or quantum photonic devices through the suppression of backscattering is a major driving force for the field of topological photonics. However, genuine protection against backscattering in photonics requires implementing architectures with broken time-reversal which is technically challenging. Here, we make use of a frequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platform to experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldane model where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. The bands’ topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states’ geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results thus open the door to harnessing topologically protected unidirectional transport of light in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems.",12/5/2024,"['photonics', 'quantum', 'photonic', 'reconstructing', 'optical']"
Differential Magnetic Force Microscopy with a Switchable Tip,"The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic force microscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostatic forces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized to map the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces from van der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tip magnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, we present an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on a flat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to a miniaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip’s magnetization. This setup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from the sidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillation spectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from other force contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup may incorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high quality factors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.",12/5/2024,"['microscope', 'electromagnet', 'electrostatic', 'magnetic', 'magnetization']"

Impact of the exciton fine structure splitting and measurement orientationson the robustness of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91,"Photons and optical circuits are among the most promising platforms for implementation of quantum technologies, because of its potential use in quantum computing, quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication.One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity.However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to the exciton fine structure splitting.This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers.We obtain analytical expressions for the protocol’s secret key rate and Bell’s parameter as functions of the studied phase and angles. Then, we validate those expressions by means of a quantum computational implementation with the IBM’s API Qiskit.Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot’s fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers.These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with quantum dots as entanglement sources.",12/4/2024,['Quantum Dots; Fine Structure Splitting; Quantum Key Distribution; Entangled-photon Sources']
Water under hydrophobic confinement: entropy and diffusion.,"The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confined geometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law can be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement which is currently a subject of intense research activity.",12/4/2024,"['hydrophobic', 'enhanced', 'intense', 'liquids', 'water']"
Self-correcting GKP qubitin a superconducting circuitwithan oscillating voltage bias,"We propose a simple circuit architecturefor a dissipatively error corrected Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit.The device consists of a electromagnetic resonator with impedance h/2⁢e2≈12.91⁢k⁢Ωℎ2superscript𝑒212.91kΩh/2e^{2}\approx 12.91\,{\rm k}\Omegaitalic_h / 2 italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ≈ 12.91 roman_k roman_Ω connected to a Josephson junction with a voltage bias oscillating at twice the resonator frequency.For large drive amplitudes,the circuit is effectively described by the GKP stabilizer Hamiltonian, whose low-energy subspace forms the code space for a qubit protected against phase-space local noise.The GKP states in the codespace can be dissipatively stabilized and error corrected by coupling the resonator to a bath through a bandpass filter; a resulting side-band cooling effect stabilizes the system in the GKP code space, dissipatively correcting it against both bit and phase flip errors.Simulations show that this dissipative error correction can enhance coherence time by factor ∼1000similar-toabsent1000\sim 1000∼ 1000 with NbN-based junctions, for operating temperatures in the ∼100⁢mKsimilar-toabsent100mK\sim 100\,{\rm mK}∼ 100 roman_mK range.The scheme can be used to stabilize both square- and hexagonal-lattice GKP codes.Finally, a Josephson current based readout scheme, and dissipatively corrected single-qubit Clifford gates are proposed.",12/4/2024,"['91kωh', 'start_postsuperscript', 'toabsent100mk', 'impedance', 'end_postsuperscript']"
Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime,"I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-André model).This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group 𝒰q⁢(𝔰⁢𝔩2)subscript𝒰𝑞𝔰subscript𝔩2\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2})caligraphic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( fraktur_s fraktur_l start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ).This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields).Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation.The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-André) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'fermions', 'mathfrak', 'mathematical', 'mathcal']"
Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals,"Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system’s nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized.As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'crystals', 'slide', 'electron', 'sliding']"
A Lower-Dimensional Remnant of Flux Attachment,"Abstract:Flux attachment is a mechanism allowing electric charges to capture magnetic flux in two spatial dimensions. Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term. This is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics of the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found after a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent coupling to matter.",12/4/2024,"['magnetic', 'transmutation', 'electric', 'flux', 'theoretic']"

To create local imbalances on stable Pb islands we use the tip of a scanning force microscope. We enforce a short, local contact between the island and our tip. The subsequent island height growth and the local contact potential difference are studied via scanning force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Though the island has a large volume increase after the contact, we observe that its surrounding wetting layer shows the same Pb density decrease as the global wetting layer. This indicates a collective density thinning of the wetting layer.",12/4/2024,"['microscope', 'microscopy', 'imbalances', 'thinning', 'surprising']"
Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene,"Collective excitations of charged particles in response to electromagnetic fields give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties.In metals, intraband collective response characterized by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength ”squeezing”, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, semiconducting materials are dominated by interband collective excitations, giving rise to exciton-polaritons with completely different properties, characterized by a superposition of the photon and exciton. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and follow a universal dispersion law for surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, we show that by electrically tuning the excitons’ energy we can enable and control their hybridization with hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons supported by the surrounding hBN, which is fully described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmons-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.",12/4/2024,"['electromagnetic', 'photon', 'interband', 'metals', 'superposition']"
Quantized Landau-level crossing checkerboard in large-angle twisted graphene,"Abstract:When charge transport occurs under conditions like topological protection or ballistic motion, the conductance of low-dimensional systems often exhibits quantized values in units of $e^{2}/h$, where $e$ and $h$ are the elementary charge and Planck's constant. Such quantization has been pivotal in quantum metrology and computing. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantized quantity: the ratio of the displacement field to the magnetic field, $D/B$, in large-twist-angle bilayer graphene. In the high magnetic field limit, Landau level crossings between the top and bottom layers manifest equal-sized checkerboard patterns throughout the $D/B$-$\nu$ space. It stems from a peculiar electric-field-driven interlayer charge transfer at one elementary charge per flux quantum, leading to quantized intervals of critical displacement fields, (i.e., $\delta D$ = $\frac{e}{2\pi l_{B}^{2}}$, where $l_B$ is the magnetic length). Our findings suggest that interlayer charge transfer in the quantum Hall regime can yield intriguing physical phenomena, which has been overlooked in the past.",12/4/2024,"['graphene', 'quantum', 'magnetic', 'metrology', 'electric']"
Robust Edge States from Band Topology in a Damped One-dimensional Magnonic Crystal,"The presence or absence of topologically-produced edge states of a crystal are robust to disorder; their stability in the presence of decay is less clear. For topologically nontrivial bosonic systems with finite particle lifetimes, such as photonic, phononic, or magnonic structures, a natural hypothesis suggests that if the linewidth from particle decay exceeds the gap between neighboring bands, then topological features such as Berry phases or edge states will lose their protection. Here we show that topological properties are significantly more robust than this, by assessing the properties of a one-dimensional magnonic crystal as the damping is increased. Even when the damping greatly exceeds the gap between neighboring bands the Zak phase of those bands is nearly unchanged, and the edge states remain clearly visible in micromagnetic simulations of microwave transmission. These results clarify the understanding of robust topological properties and bulk-boundary correspondence.",12/3/2024,"['photonic', 'disorder', 'damping', 'topologically', 'crystal']"
Damping Enhancement in YIG at Millikelvin Temperatures due to GGG Substrate,"Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural compatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below 50 K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping in a 97 nm-thick YIG film on a 500 µm-thick GGG substrate at temperatures down to 30 mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase in FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic field generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate. Numerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth enhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and frequencies above 18 GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous Gilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the damping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of solid-state quantum technologies.",12/3/2024,"['nanoscale', 'ferromagnetic', 'quantum', 'spectroscopy', 'ferrimagnetic']"

New interpretation of the original charged BTZ black hole spacetime,"Abstract: In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ)proposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinningBTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a`static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations aresatisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, theMaxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of thecorresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin haveproposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analyticrotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that theoriginal charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of theDeshpande--Lunin theory.

We find that the peak of the radialeffective potential decreases with the quantum parameter $\hat{k}$. We alsoexamine the impact of quantum corrections on the properties of stable circularorbits around the polymerized black hole. Given that gravitational radiationinduces changes in the energy and orbital angular momentum of the smallerobject, we model its trajectory as an adiabatic evolution along stable circularorbits. The corresponding gravitational waveforms are generated using thenumerical kludge method, revealing that quantum corrections cause phaseadvances in the gravitational waveforms.

Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a quantum-corrected  black hole,"Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals are crucial sources for future space-basedgravitational wave detections. Gravitational waveforms emitted by extrememass-ratio inspirals are closely related to the orbital dynamics of smallcelestial objects, which vary with the underlying spacetime geometry. Despitethe tremendous success of general relativity, there are unsolved issues such assingularities in both black holes and cosmology. Loop quantum gravity, a theoryaddressing these singularity problems, offers a framework for regular blackholes. In this paper, we focus on periodic orbits of a small celestial objectaround a supermassive quantum-corrected black hole in loop quantum gravity andcompute the corresponding gravitational waveforms. We view the small celestialobject as a massive test particle and obtain its four-velocity and effectivepotential. Our results indicate that the quantum parameter $\hat{\alpha}$influences the shape of the effective potential. We explore the effects ofquantum corrections on marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circularorbits, and other periodic orbits. Using the numerical kludge scheme, wefurther explore the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object alongdifferent periodic orbits. The waveforms exhibit distinct zoom and whirl phasesin a complete orbital period, closely tied to the quantum parameter$\hat{\alpha}$. We also perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational wavesfrom these periodic orbits and assess their detectability. With the steadyprogress of space-based gravitational wave detection programs, our findingswill contribute to utilizing extreme mass-ratio inspirals to test andunderstand the properties of quantum-corrected black holes.",6/29/2024,"['cosmology', 'spacetime', 'relativity', 'quantum', 'celestialobject']"

DHOST theories as disformal gravity: From black holes to radiative  spacetimes,"Abstract: This manuscript reviews the construction of exact solutions describing both(rotating) black holes and non-linear radiative spacetimes in the context ofdegenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We start be reviewingthe structure of the DHOST theory space, the notion of degeneracy conditionsand the stability of these degeneracy classes under disformal fieldredefinition (DFR). Then we discuss several key notions related to stationaryand axi-symmetric black holes, and in particular the no-hair theorems derivedin GR and in its scalar-tensor extensions. The rest of the chapters are devotedto the disformal solution generating map use to construct new hairy black holessolutions. A brief review of the rotating black holes solutions found so far inthis context and a detailed description of the disformed Kerr black hole, wefurther comment on on-going efforts to construct rotating black hole solutionsmimicking the closest the Kerr geometry.

To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond,"Abstract: It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncingcosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entireevolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singularbounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, thevector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed withoutencountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that suchmodels unavoidably lead to either an instability in the matter sector or strongcoupling in the scalar one. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independentway, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singularbounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found forHorndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyondgeneralized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamicalnature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it anill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.",12/5/2024,"['instability', 'pathologies', 'relativity', 'difficult', 'bouncingcosmology']"
Using the Difference of the Inclinations of a Pair of Counter-Orbiting  Satellites to Measure the Lense-Thirring Effect,"Abstract: Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary alongideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the generalexpressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by thepost-Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the centralobject, it turns out that the Lense-Thirring inclination rates of A and B areequal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary's oblatenessare identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the twoorbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects byenhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbitalconfigurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observableconsequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenarioinvolving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites(POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt inthe mid-1970s, is considered.

Energy Extraction from Loop Quantum Black Holes: The Role of Magnetic  Penrose Process and Quantum Gravity Effects with Astrophysical Insights,"Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of quantum gravitational corrections,derived from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), on the efficiency of the magneticPenrose process (MPP) in black hole (BH) environments. We begin by analyzingthe rotating Loop Quantum Black Hole (LQBH) metric, describing the structure ofthe event horizon and ergosphere as functions of the quantum parameter$\epsilon = \gamma \delta$, with $\gamma$ representing the Immirzi parameterand $\delta$ the polymeric parameter, and the spin parameter $a$. Thesemodifications provide a novel setting for exploring the dynamics of chargedparticles near the LQBH and evaluating the resultant energy extraction throughthe MPP. Interestingly, for a given value of the LQBH parameter $a$, we observethat the ergosphere region of the LQBH exhibits a more intricate structurecompared to its classical counterpart, the Kerr BH, as $\epsilon$ increases.Furthermore, we find that the overall efficiency of the process decreases with$\epsilon$ that decreases $a_{max}$, again in contrast to the Kerr BH, whereefficiency rises with an increasing $a$. Our analysis also extends toastrophysical contexts, applying constraints on the mass and magnetic field ofLQBHs for astrophysical BH candidates, including SgrA*, M87*, NGC 1052, and BZ(Blandford and Znajek sources, i.e., supermassive BHs with masses around $10^9M_\odot$ and magnetic fields in the range $10^3-10^4 \text{G}$).

We fill this gap by analysing what QSL arises when superposingspherically symmetric masses in canonical quantum gravity. By this procedure,we find that the quantum mechanical Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin boundscan be improved by superposing a spherically symmetric, static andasymptotically flat spacetime between states with different ADM energies andmass densities. We discuss the feasibility and significance of measuring timesvia these superpositions.",12/4/2024,"['quantumgravity', 'quantumspeed', 'quantum', 'spacetime', 'abstract']"
Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame:  strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations,"Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of dissipative fluids byadopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion paper we showthat this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states,here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into afirst-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting thesystem in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, weshow that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to awell-posed Cauchy problem.",12/4/2024,"['rewriting', 'equations', 'new', 'theory', 'showthat']"
"Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame:  hyperbolicity, causality and stability","Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of dissipative fluids in the trace-fixedparticle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperatureis determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory ishyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers,the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channelsare recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbersis also analyzed.

"GRoovy: A General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Code for Dynamical  Spacetimes with Curvilinear Coordinates, Tabulated Equations of State, and  Neutrino Physics","Abstract: Many astrophysical systems of interest to numerical relativity, such asrapidly rotating stars, black hole accretion disks, and core-collapsesupernovae, exhibit near-symmetries. These systems generally consist of astrongly gravitating central object surrounded by an accretion disk, debris,and ejecta. Simulations can efficiently exploit the near-axisymmetry of thesesystems by reducing the number of points in the angular direction around thenear-symmetry axis, enabling efficient simulations over seconds-long timescaleswith minimal computational expense. In this paper, we introduce GRoovy, a novelcode capable of modeling astrophysical systems containing compact objects bysolving the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) in fullgeneral relativity using singular curvilinear (spherical-like andcylindrical-like) and Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrate the code'srobustness through a battery of challenging GRHD tests, ranging from flat,static spacetimes to curved, dynamical spacetimes. These tests further showcasethe code's capabilities in modeling systems with realistic, finite-temperatureequations of state and neutrino cooling via a leakage scheme. GRoovyextensively leverages GRHayL, an open-source, modular, andinfrastructure-agnostic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics library builtfrom the highly robust algorithms of IllinoisGRMHD. Long-term simulations ofbinary neutron star and black hole-neutron star post-merger remnants willbenefit greatly from GRoovy to study phenomena such as remnant stability,gamma-ray bursts, and nucleosynthesis.",12/4/2024,"['astrophysical', 'spacetimes', 'neutrino', 'magnetohydrodynamics', 'algorithms']"
A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at  High Energies,"Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in thesuper-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used tocalculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansionparameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$,respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative seriescontains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidityrenormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theoremwhich allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinearjet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite towerof operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running ofthe leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectorywhile the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitationalBFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two resultspreviously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees(up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that theconvolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that ofQCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where wecan use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. Theleading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without goingbeyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansionfollows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th orderpiece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. Thefactorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternatebetween being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.",12/5/2024,"['expansionparameters', 'quantum', 'planckian', 'gravitationalbfkl', 'theoremwhich']"
Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of 4D Dyonic AdS Black Holes:  Insights from Kaniadakis Statistics and Emergence of Superfluid  $λ$-Phase Transition,"Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $4D$ dyonic AdS black hole in the Kaniadakisstatistics framework using the Restricted Phase Space (RPST) formalism. Thisframework provides a non-extensive extension of classical statisticalmechanics, drawing inspiration from relativistic symmetries and presenting afresh perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our study analyzes howincluding Kaniadakis entropy modifies the phase transition of the dyonic blackholes. We consider the central charge $C$ and its conjugate chemical potential$\mu$ as the thermodynamic variable along with others except the pressure andvolume. Due to the addition of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$, the study ofthe phase transition becomes much richer by obtaining a non-equilibrium phasetransition from an unstable small black hole to a stable large black hole alongwith the Van der Waals phase transition in the $T-S$ processes. In the $F-T$plot, we get an extra Hawking-Page phase transition. Including the deformationparameter $\kappa$ introduces an unstable (ultra-large BH) branch seen inalmost all the plots. Turning off the magnetic charge flips the direction ofthe phase transition seen during its presence. We observe a novel phenomenonthat is the superfluid $\lambda$ phase transition in the mixed$(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ which is due to the additional $\tilde{Q}_m$inclusion. Also, in the plots varying $\kappa$ match with the plot varying $C$which underlines some sort of correspondence in its meaning which is notpossible to observe in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. As the entropy models changethe homogeneity is not lost where mass is of the first order and the rest iszeroth order. Finally, the $\mu-C$ processes in quite similar across black holesystems and entropy formulation marking some kind of universality of thisprocess.",12/5/2024,"['thermodynamics', 'thermodynamic', 'statisticalmechanics', 'holesystems', 'boltzmann']"
Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case,"Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundednesscondition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining ourspaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a)the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b)Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronologicaldiamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distancefunction. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity ofdesirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. Thedefinition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded caseis generalised to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorffconvergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces areGH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric space bringa natural quasi-uniformity (resp.\ quasi-metric). Finally, an explicitcomparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work onbounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.",12/5/2024,"['hausdorffconvergence', 'chronologicaldiamonds', 'distancefunction', 'lorentzian', 'drops']"
"Traversable wormhole for string, but not for particle","Abstract: We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed stringmassless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the stringframe, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence ofthe wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middleregion contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions formnon-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin toa non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete withineach region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometrydifferently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.",12/5/2024,"['stringmassless', 'wormhole', 'geometrydifferently', 'riemannian', 'stringframe']"
"A $Λ$CDM Extension Explaining the Hubble Tension and the Spatial  Curvature $Ω_{k,0} = -0.012 \pm 0.010$ Measured by the Final PR4 of the  Planck Mission","Abstract: The measurements of the CMB have determined the cosmological parameters withhigh accuracy, and the observation of the flatness of space have contributed tothe status of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the cosmologicalconstant $\Lambda$, necessary to close the model to critical density, remainsan open conundrum. We explore the observed late-time accelerated expansion ofthe Universe, where we consider that the Friedmann equation describes theexpansion history of FLRW universes in the local reference frame of freelyfalling comoving observers, which perceive flat, homogeneous and isotropicspace in their local inertial system, where, as a consequence of theequivalence principle, special relativity applies. We use this fact to proposean extension to $\Lambda$CDM, incorporating the initial conditions of thebackground universe, comprising the initial energy densities as well as theinitial post big bang expansion rate. The observed late-time acceleratedexpansion is then attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energycomponent. Choosing the same $\Omega_{m,0} \simeq 0.3$ as $\Lambda$CDM, itsequation of state $w_{de} \simeq -0.8$. Furthermore, we include the impact onthe expansion history caused by the cosmic web of the late Universe, once voidsdominate its volume, and find that the initially constant $w_{de}$ becomestime-dependent, evolving to a value of $w_{de} \simeq -0.9$ at the present.While this impact by voids is minor, it is sufficient to provide a solution tothe Hubble tension problem. We use CLASS to calculate the expansion history andpower spectra of our extension and compare our results to concordance$\Lambda$CDM and to observations. We find that our model agrees well withcurrent data, in particular with the final data release PR4 of the Planckmission, where it explains the reported spatial curvature of $\Omega_{k,0} = -0.012 \pm 0.010$.",12/5/2024,"['cosmologicalconstant', 'cosmological', 'relativity', 'planckmission', 'cosmic']"
Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography,"Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography imposea lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimireffect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and brieflycomment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions.Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound ofthe Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Isingmodel, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, theholographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theorieswithout conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoreticalproof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.",12/5/2024,"['theorieswithout', 'counterexample', 'casimireffect', 'holography', 'quantum']"

The spectrum of near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes and the ABJM mass gap,"Abstract: Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \times S^7$ areexpected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJMsuperconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfullydemonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black holemetrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies inthe low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of thenear horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixedgrand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman blackholes are described by a version of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theorywith $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties ofABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightestnear BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimensionspectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results areconsistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrixtheory at low energies, and the microscopic index.",12/4/2024,"['blackholes', 'holemetrics', 'quantum', 'black', 'supersymmetric']"
Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes,"Abstract: For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric indexhas provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In thenear-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed thesemiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy(consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS blackholes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of thespectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of$\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focuson near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$SCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5branes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantumcorrections to their charges, and when $\vartheta = \pi$ one may find a mixed`t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversalsymmetries. Using results from $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find theseeffects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, andmay even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\vartheta \rightarrow \pi$, neither theBekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremaldegeneracies.",12/4/2024,"['quantumcorrections', 'blackholes', 'supersymmetric', 'reversalsymmetries', 'gravitational']"
The Diagonal Approximation for Holographic Rényi Entropies,"Abstract: Recently Dong, Rath and Kudler-Flam proposed a modified cosmic braneprescription for computing the R\'{e}nyi entropy $S_\alpha$ of a holographicsystem in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. This prescription wasfound by assuming a diagonal approximation, where the R\'{e}nyi entropy iscomputed after first measuring the areas of all extremal surfaces. We derivethis diagonal approximation and show that it accurately computes R\'{e}nyientropies up to $O(\log G)$ corrections. For $\alpha<1$, this allows us toderive the modified cosmic brane prescription, which differs from the originalcosmic brane prescription at leading order in $G$. For $\alpha>1$, it leads tothe original cosmic brane prescription without needing to assume that replicasymmetry is unbroken in the bulk.",12/4/2024,"['replicasymmetry', 'holographicsystem', 'cosmic', 'computing', 'braneprescription']"
Precision calibration of calorimeter signals in the ATLAS experiment  using an uncertainty-aware neural network,Abstract: The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider explores the use of modernneural networks for a multi-dimensional calibration of its calorimeter signaldefined by clusters of topologically connected cells (topo-clusters). TheBayesian neural network (BNN) approach not only yields a continuous and smoothcalibration function that improves performance relative to the standardcalibration but also provides uncertainties on the calibrated energies for eachtopo-cluster. The results obtained by using a trained BNN are compared to thestandard local hadronic calibration and to a calibration provided by training adeep neural network. The uncertainties predicted by the BNN are interpreted inthe context of a fractional contribution to the systematic uncertainties of thetrained calibration. They are also compared to uncertainty predictions obtainedfrom an alternative estimator employing repulsive ensembles.,12/5/2024,"['modernneural', 'neural', 'collider', 'ensembles', 'calibration']"

Model-agnostic search for dijet resonances with anomalous jet  substructure in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV,"Abstract: This paper presents a model-agnostic search for narrow resonances in thedijet final state in the mass range 1.8-6 TeV. The signal is assumed to producejets with substructure atypical of jets initiated by light quarks or gluons,with minimal additional assumptions. Search regions are obtained by utilizingmultivariate machine-learning methods to select jets with anomaloussubstructure. A collection of complementary anomaly detection methods - basedon unsupervised, weakly supervised, and semisupervised algorithms - are used inorder to maximize the sensitivity to unknown new physics signatures. Thesealgorithms are applied to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a center-of-massenergy of 13 TeV. No significant excesses above background expectations areseen. Exclusion limits are derived on the production cross section of benchmarksignal models varying in resonance mass, jet mass, and jet substructure. Manyof these signatures have not been previously sought, making several of thelimits reported on the corresponding benchmark models the first ever.

Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with  symmetry-preserving attention networks,"Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct wayto measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as wellas potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhanceproduction at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest eventfraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs bosondecays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces acombinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigningjets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attentionnetworks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge.However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneouslyconsidering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e.,two ""resolved"" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a$b$-quark or one ""boosted"" large-radius jet containing a merged showerinitiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstructionefficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce ageneralization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boostedand resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an eventas ""fully resolved'', ""fully boosted"", or in between. We report the performanceof baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized versionon nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boostedand resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs bosonreconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared tothe baseline method depending on the final state.",12/5/2024,"['quark', 'mathrm', 'attentionnetworks', 'reconstructionefficiency', 'bosons']"

In this work, we usethree representative models with scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector forcecarriers to map out the darkonium signatures at both high-energy and low-energycolliders. Some of the bound states can be stable due to generalized parity andcharge-conjugation symmetries, while others decay into light dark-forcecarriers, which subsequently can decay at a displaced vertex.

This study focuses on interpretingParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the$\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particleattends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParTshows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay,indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables.These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings andlearning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency oftransformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.",12/4/2024,"['transformermodels', 'physics', 'algorithms', 'particletransformer', 'particleattends']"
Tribute to Henry Primakoff:Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via  Primakoff Reactions,"Abstract: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very highenergy particles (pions, kaons, {\gamma} gamma-rays) from photon targets,{\gamma}* virtual photons in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Primakoffwas the first to describe how to determine the {\pi}0 lifetime by measuring the{\gamma}{\gamma}* -> {\pi}0 production cross section. For the case that a highenergy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the restframe of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of ~250 MeV gammarays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energyhard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the QuantumChromodynamics (QCD) framework. A short description is presented of Primakoff'sscientific career and personal life. Here, we focus on a review of PrimakoffScattering studies of pion polarizability and the {\gamma}->{\pi}{\pi}{\pi}chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, and of the {\pi}0 lifetime at JeffersonLaboratory (Jlab). Following a brief review of Chiral Perturbation Theory(ChPT), we discuss the good agreement of the results of these studies with2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBERfor kaon polarizability and {\gamma}->{\pi}{\pi}{\eta} and {\gamma}->KK{\pi}chiral anomalies, and at Jlab for the {\pi}0 and {\eta} lifetimes, areimportant for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u,d,s) ChPT.The transition from 2-flavor to 3-flavor ChPT incorporates the strange quark,which is crucial for understanding the full dynamics of the light mesons(pions, kaons, and etas). By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data forkaons, {\pi}0 and {\eta}, it will be possible to assess how well the modelcaptures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strangequarks.",12/4/2024,"['quantumchromodynamics', 'highenergy', 'photon', 'photons', 'gammarays']"
Direct Deflection of Millicharged Radiation,"Abstract: Millicharged particles are generic in theories of dark sectors. A cosmic orlocal abundance of them may be produced by the early universe, stellarenvironments, or the decay or annihilation of dark matter/dark energy.Furthermore, if such particles are light, these production channels result in abackground of millicharged radiation. We show that light-shining-through-wallexperiments employing superconducting RF cavities can also be used as ``directdeflection"" experiments to search for this relativistic background. Themillicharged plasma is first subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic fieldof a driven cavity, which causes charge separation in the form of charge andcurrent perturbations. In turn, these perturbations can propagate outwards andresonantly excite electromagnetic fields in a well-shielded cavity placednearby, enabling detection. We estimate that future versions of the existingDark SRF experiment can probe orders of magnitude of currently unexploredparameter space, including millicharges produced from the Sun, the cosmicneutrino background, or other mechanisms that generate a thermal abundance withenergy density as small as $\sim 10^{-4}$ that of the cosmic microwavebackground.",12/4/2024,"['cosmicneutrino', 'radiation', 'stellarenvironments', 'plasma', 'cosmic']"

Measurement of the inclusive WZ production cross section in pp  collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV,"Abstract: The inclusive WZ production cross section is measured in proton-protoncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, using data collected during2022 with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34.7fb$^{-1}$. The measurement uses multileptonic final states and a simultaneouslikelihood fit to the number of events in four different lepton flavourcategories: eee, ee$\mu$, $\mu\mu $e, and $\mu\mu\mu$. The selection isoptimized to minimize the number of background events, and relies on anefficient prompt lepton discrimination strategy. The WZ production crosssection is measured in a phase space defined within a 30 GeV window around theZ boson mass, as $\sigma_{\text{total}}$(pp$\to$WZ) = 55.2$\pm$1.2 (stat)$\pm$1.2 (syst) $\pm$0.8 (lumi) $\pm$0.1 (theo) pb. In addition, the crosssection is measured in a fiducial phase space closer to the detector-levelrequirements. All the measurements presented in this paper are in agreementwith standard model predictions.",12/3/2024,"['protoncollisions', 'proton', 'multileptonic', 'during2022', 'lepton']"
Quantum theory of neutron in magnetic field and neutron-electron  collider,"Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in themagnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauliequation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite,for any miltipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study ofneutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole. Our predictions agree with theresults of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finiteand infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in theBudker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude withthe proposal of neutron-electron intersecting ring (neutron-electron``collider''), which, if realized, would allow to accomplish a number ofimportant experiments devoting to study neutron internal structure.",12/3/2024,"['physics', 'nuclear', 'neutron', 'neutrons', 'quantum']"
Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal  Majoron models of neutrino mass,"Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in awide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality ofactive neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochasticgravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraintson the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagradata. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions ofparameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signalat LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while apositive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the otherhand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detecta SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.",12/3/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'stochasticgravitational', 'supercooled', 'supercooling']"
"Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation,  co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in","Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has beenextensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An importantparameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). Allthe previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilationprocesses for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming thatthe singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, wedemonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with adependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for themixing angle $\sin\theta<0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameterspace of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation,co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes.Additionally, the freeze-in parameter space is also explored. We found that dueto the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic densityparameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHCand MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.",12/3/2024,"['decade', 'annihilationprocesses', 'importantparameter', 'densityparameter', 'annihilation']"
Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant $α_s$ from Inclusive  Semi-leptonic $B$ Meson Decays,"Abstract: We present a new methodology for determining the strong coupling constant,$\alpha_s$, from the inclusive semi-leptonic decay width of $B$ mesons. Weexpress the semi-leptonic $B$ decay width as a function of $\alpha_s$(5 GeV),the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, $b$- and $c$-quarkmasses in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme. The method fixes the value of$|V_{cb}|$ according to the recent measurement from Belle based on exclusive$B$ decays and uses the PDG averages for the $b$- and $c$-quark masses. Byfitting $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$ to current world averages of the $B^{\pm}$and $B^{0}$ semi-leptonic decay widths, the analysis obtains$\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV}) = 0.225 \pm 0.012$, corresponding to a 5-flavorextrapolation of $\alpha_s(m_{Z}) = 0.121 \pm 0.003$. Taking into accountfuture results from higher-order perturbative QCD calculations, heavy quarkmasses derived from lattice QCD, and measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ as well as $B$decay widths from upcoming $B$ and $Z$ factory data, this method could yield adetermination of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ with a competitive precision of$\Delta\alpha_s(m_{Z}) \sim 0.0018$. This precision is comparable to thecurrent accuracy of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ measurements from $\tau$ decays, which isregarded as the most precise approach.",12/3/2024,"['flavorextrapolation', 'quarkmasses', 'leptonic', 'mathrm', 'weexpress']"
Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy  baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory,"Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$singly heavy baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up to$\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the magneticmoments of singly charmed baryons from lattice QCD simulations and theexperimental decay widths of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Sigma_c^*$. Our results indicatethat the long-range chiral corrections make significant contributions to thepolarizabilities. Additionally, the magnetic dipole transitions$\mathcal{B}_6^* \to \mathcal{B}_6 +\gamma $ also provide large contribution tothe magnetic polarizabilities.",12/3/2024,"['magneticmoments', 'mathcal', 'magnetic', 'electromagnetic', 'thepolarizabilities']"
96 GeV Scalar Boson in the 2HDM with U(1)_H Gauge Symmetry,"Abstract: In this paper, we study two Higgs doublet models with gauged U(1)_H symmetry,motivated by the excesses around 96 GeV reported by the CMS collaboration inthe searches for light resonances decaying to two photons and two \tau's. Inthis model, one Higgs doublet field is charged under the U(1)_H symmetry toavoid tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. The extra gauge symmetryrequires extra chiral fermions, to satisfy the anomaly-free conditions. Weanalyze the signals of the light resonances, taking into account thecontribution of the extra fermions, and discuss the consistency with theexperimental results in this model.",12/3/2024,"['fermions', 'photons', 'symmetryrequires', 'weanalyze', 'higgs']"
Remarks on strong phase shifts in weak nonleptonic baryon decays,"Abstract: A sizable strong-interaction phase shift in weak two-body nonleptonic baryondecay would enhance the possibility of discovering charge-conjugation parity($CP$) violation in the baryon sector, which might help in the quest forunderstanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Over the past 60years, empirical analyses involving different types of instruments, includingfixed-target experiments and $e^+e^-$ colliders, have indicated that the phaseshifts in nonleptonic hyperon decays are relatively small, below order tendegrees in size. A large phase shift, however, has been observed by BESIII inthe decay of a charmed baryon into a hyperon and kaon, $\Lambda_c^+\to\Xi^0K^+$. In various experimental and theoretical studies on hyperon,charmed-baryon, and bottomed-baryon decays, different conventions have beenadopted for defining the strong phases. It is important to be aware of thissituation when obtaining global averages from different measurements andapplying the results to future investigations on $CP$ violation among baryons.This paper gives an overview of the conventions employed in the literature forthe strong phases and suggests a unified parameterization form applicable tothe different alternatives. Numerical results under the unifiedparameterization form are also provided, which can serve as useful inputs tofurther pursuits of baryon $CP$ violation.",12/3/2024,"['antimatter', 'colliders', 'theoretical', 'unifiedparameterization', 'decay']"
Constraints on the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model from di-lepton resonance  searches at the LHC,"Abstract: We confront the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model with bounds coming from a searchfor resonances in the di-lepton channels at the 13~TeV LHC. In contrast to theoriginal $B_3-L_2$ model, the $Z^\prime$ of the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model hassizeable couplings to the lighter two families; these originate from orderunity kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson and ameliorate the fit tolepton flavour universality measurements in $B-$meson decays. The $Z^\prime$coupling to the first two families of quark means that the resultingconstraints from resonant di-lepton searches are stronger. Nevertheless, wefind that for $M_{Z^\prime}>2.8$ TeV there remains a non-negligible region ofallowed parameter space where the model significantly improves upon severalStandard Model predictions for observables involving the $b \rightarrow s l^+l^-$ transition. We estimate that the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ HL-LHC will extend thissensitivity to $M_{Z^\prime}= 4.2$ TeV.",12/2/2024,"['lhc', 'lepton', 'hypercharge', 'quark', 'resultingconstraints']"
Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements,"Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functionswith improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorousquantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm andspurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extendthis framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built frommultiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) byconstructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as wellas a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test thatgeneralizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczosmethod directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, whichcan be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczosprovides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous tothe benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including fasterconvergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computabletwo-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements ofexternal currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits orstatistical inference are required.

Numerical study of the dimensionally reduced 3D Ising model,"Abstract: We study the 3D Ising model in the infinite volume limit $N_{x,y,z}\to\infty$by means of numerical simulations. We determine $T_c$ as well as the criticalexponents $\beta,\gamma$ and $\nu$, based on finite-size scaling and histogramreweighting techniques. In addition, we study a ``dimensionally reduced''scenario where $N_z$ is kept fixed (e.g. at 2, 4, 8), while the limit$N_{x,y}\to\infty$ is taken. For each fixed $N_z$ we determine $T_c$ as well as$\beta,\gamma,\nu$. For $T_c$ we find a smooth transition curve which connectsthe well known critical temperatures of the 2D and the 3D Ising model.Regarding $\beta,\gamma,\nu$ our data suggest that the ``dimensionallyreduced'' Ising model is in the same universality class as the 2D Ising model,regardless of $N_z$.",12/5/2024,"['3d', 'dimensionallyreduced', 'simulations', 'numerical', 'n_z']"
Winding number on 3D lattice,"Abstract: We propose a simple numerical method which computes an approximate value ofthe winding number of a mapping from 3D torus~$T^3$ to the unitarygroup~$U(N)$, when $T^3$ is approximated by discrete lattice points. Our methodconsists of a ``tree-level improved'' discretization of the winding number andthe gradient flow associated with an ``over-improved'' lattice action. Byemploying a one-parameter family of mappings from $T^3$ to $SU(2)$ with knownwinding numbers, we demonstrate that the method works quite well even forcoarse lattices, reproducing integer winding numbers in a good accuracy. Ourmethod can trivially be generalized to the case of higher-dimensional tori.",12/5/2024,"['mappings', 'methodconsists', 'mapping', 'reproducing', 'numerical']"
Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice,"Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodicspacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g.,Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g.,Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence betweenspacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which isunderstood as different physical representations of the same mathematicalobject, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum groupis generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namelya linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), thetwo components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position andmomentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in aperiodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in aperiodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The threelattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, andAubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams,self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantizedcurrent in the incommensurate regimes.",12/4/2024,"['mathematicalobject', 'quantum', 'fermions', 'mathfrak', 'periodicspacetime']"
Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory  at $θ=π$ from imaginary $θ$ simulations,"Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theoryat $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of thehigher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we useMonte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since itis the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations areavailable. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, wherethe sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$.We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to beused in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of thetopological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and providean evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at lowtemperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature.This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yetdiffers from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.",12/4/2024,"['carlo', 'deconfining', 'simulations', 'calculations', 'areavailable']"

Stable solutions of theRoy-Steiner equations with different quantum numbers of isospin and angularmomentum are obtained in the elastic energy region, by taking inputs from the$\pi K$ lattice data in the inelastic region, the lattice data from the crossed$\pi\pi \to K\bar{K}$ channels, the masses of $f_0(500)$ and $K^*$ at the samepion mass from previous study, and the Regge model. Predictions on the elastic$\pi K$ scattering phase shifts and the $K_0^*(700)$ pole content are made.Contrary to the virtual pole scenario obtained using the $K$-matrix method inthe literature, we find that lightest strange scalar meson $K_0^*(700)$ remainsa broad resonance at $M_\pi=391~$MeV.

In the finite density region with $\mu\ne 0$, where this modelsuffers from the sign problem in the standard Monte Carlo approach, weinvestigate the properties of the quantum phase transition. We determine thetransition point $\mu_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent of the correlationlength $\nu$ from the $\mu$ dependence of the number density in thethermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical exponent $z$ is also extracted fromthe scaling behavior of the temporal correlation length as a function of $\mu$.This is the first successful calculation of the dynamical critical exponentwith the TRG method.",12/4/2024,"['tensorrenormalization', 'weinvestigate', 'quantum', 'neumann', 'thethermodynamic']"

Effective Strings in QED$_3$,"Abstract: Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings intheories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the sameorder as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class ofconfining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov,for which $M_{gap}^2\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energiesof order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, weanalyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, atenergies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\sqrt{T}$). We argue thatthe width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long.We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energyof a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosonson the string worldsheet.",12/2/2024,"['physics', 'strings', 'theories', 'string', 'goldstone']"

One remarkable characteristic of the NLSMis asymptotic freedom, which triggers interest in perturbative calculations. Inthe lattice formulation of NLSM, one would naturally rely on NumericalStochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT) to conduct high-order computations.However, when dealing with low-dimensional systems, NSPT reveals increasingstatistical fluctuations with higher and higher orders. This of course does notcome as a surprise and one is ready to live with this, as long as the noise isnot going to completely kill the signal, which unfortunately in some modelsdoes take place. We investigate how, in the $O(N)$ context, this behaviourstrongly depends on $N$.

Lefschetz thimble-inspired weight regularizations for complex Langevin  simulations,"Abstract: Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numericalsign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and thereal-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that,depending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. Inthis work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of thecomplex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure ofthe simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight functionregularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Ourresults indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized systemexhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction toretrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a directcomplex Langevin approach fails.

Here we showthat these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivialtopological sector of the boundary gauge fields.

Superposing and gauging fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair  states to get lattice gauge theory groundstates,"Abstract: Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) form anovel type of Ansatz state for the groundstate of lattice gauge theories. Theadvantage of these states is that they allow efficient calculation ofobservables by combining Monte-Carlo integration over gauge fieldsconfigurations with Gaussian tensor network machinery for the fermionic part.Remarkably, for GGFPEPS the probability distribution for the gauge fieldconfigurations is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.In this work we will demonstrate that gauged (non-Gaussian) fermionicprojected pair states (GFPEPS) exactly capture the groundstate of genericlattice gauge theories. Additionally, we will present a framework for theefficient computation of observables in the case where the non-Gaussianity ofthe PEPS follows from the superposition of (few) Gaussian PEPS.Finally, we present a new graphical notation for Gaussian tensor and theircontractions into Gaussian tensor network states.",12/2/2024,"['fermionic', 'fermionicprojected', 'efficient', 'tensor', 'ofobservables']"

Meson spectroscopy in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory with three antisymmetric  fermions,"Abstract: We report the results of an extensive numerical study of the $Sp(4)$ latticegauge theory with three (Dirac) flavors of fermion in the two-indexantisymmetric representation. In the presence of (degenerate) fermion masses,the theory has an enhanced global $SU(6)$ symmetry, broken explicitly andspontaneously to its $SO(6)$ subgroup. This symmetry breaking pattern makes thetheory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models,as well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness. It can alsoprovide a dynamical realisation of the strongly interacting massive particleparadigm for the origin of dark matter. We adopt the standard plaquette gaugeaction with the Wilson-Dirac formulation for the fermions and apply the(rational) hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in our ensemble generation process. Wemonitor the autocorrelation and topology of the ensembles. We explore the bareparameter space, and identify the weak and strong coupling regimes separated bya line of first-order bulk phase transitions.We measure two-point correlation functions between meson operators thattransform as non-trivial representations of $SO(6)$, and extract theground-state masses and the decay constants, in all accessible spin and paritychannels. In addition, we measure the mass of the first excited state for thevector meson by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem.

Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation  functions III: coupled-channels,"Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal} that connectsintegrated correlation function of a trapped two-particle system to infinitevolume scattering phase shift is further extended to coupled-channel systems inthe present work. Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as anexample, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in thesingle channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in bothchannels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactlysolvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. Itis further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of aquasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. Inall cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trapsize is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidateto overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.",12/1/2024,"['2023ecc', '2024zal', 'quantum', 'bothchannels', 'connectsintegrated']"
Unitarity bounds with subthreshold and anomalous cuts for $b$-hadron  decays,"Abstract: We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization.Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts --namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard''unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by theBGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\toD^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which areparticularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how toparametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence ofsubthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a widerange of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimisingsystematic uncertainties.",12/5/2024,"['anomalous', 'lambda_b', 'parametrization', 'uncertainties', 'minimisingsystematic']"
High-energy cLFV at $μ$TRISTAN: HNL extensions of the Standard Model,"Abstract: Within the context of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) extensions of the StandardModel, we compute the cross-sections for $\mu^+ e^-\to\ell_\alpha^+\ell_\beta^-$ scattering, as well as several angular observables.In particular, we investigate the future sensitivity of a $\mu$TRISTAN colliderin discovering such charged lepton flavour violating processes and thepotential constraining power of these searches on the parameter space of HNLmodels. Our results show that while low-energy probes of $\mu-e$ flavourviolation do offer the most promising potential, the prospects for $e\tau$ and$\mu\tau$ flavour violation searches at $\mu$TRISTAN can exceed those ofrelated low-energy probes (as well as flavour violating $Z$-pole processes atFCC-ee) by several orders of magnitude.",12/5/2024,"['colliderin', 'hnlmodels', 'lepton', 'flavourviolation', 'hnl']"
Peccei-Quinn charges in the 3-3-1 model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry,"Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism is applied within the $\mathrm{SU(3)_c\otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X}$ model with B-L symmetry. The structures in thePQ chargesof all fermions and scalar fields in the model are investigated by applyingthe invariant condition underthe symmetry group on all Yukawa interaction terms. All defined PQ chargesjust depend on PQ charge of the only complex singlet scalar in the model. Themixing and mass hierachy in the scalar sector of the model are studied indetail. As the result, the physical state of axion is a linear combinationof all imaginary parts of scalar multiplets as general form.

We gave the dark matter overproductionand the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ andthe axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predictedgravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the currentpulsar timing array experiments.",12/5/2024,"['cosmic', 'predictedgravitational', 'gravitational', 'latticesimulation', 'nucleosynthesis']"
Renormalization of effective field theories via on-shell methods: the  case of axion-like particles,"Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations of axion-like particleeffective field theories and determine the corresponding anomalous dimensionsat one loop via on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The calculation of thephase-space cut-integrals is carried out using different integration methods,among which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to betechnically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynmandiagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitlyverify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more directand elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions ofoperators that are dual under the CP symmetry.",12/5/2024,"['renormalization', 'theorem', 'particleeffective', 'feynmandiagrammatic', 'equations']"

The QCDcorrections are applied in both the production and the decay stages of the fourtop quarks by employing the narrow-width approximation. The spin correlationsare therefore preserved at NLO accuracy in QCD without any approximation.

We show howto define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, andscattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights,other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transferrates, or a neutrino interaction rate. We show that NLO corrections to theenergy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previouslydetermined neutrino interaction rate, and are therefore expected to have only asmall influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. We alsoprovide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differentialrates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations,which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Modelprediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$",12/5/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'plasmadetermine', 'antineutrinos', 'decoupling']"
Eogenesis via the High-scale Electroweak Symmetry Restoration,"Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel electron-assisted Baryogenesis scenariothat does not require explicit B-L violation, which is essential for thetraditional Leptogenesis mechanism. This scenario is based on the assumption ofhigh-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, which implies that the electronYukawa interaction, crucial for the mechanism, does not reach thermalequilibrium before the electroweak sphaleron process is quenched in the earlyuniverse. Primordial charge asymmetries for chiral electrons, which can begenerated through various mechanisms such as axion inflation, the evaporationof primordial black holes, or the CP-asymmetric decays of a heavy Higgsdoublet, serve as the initial condition for the amplification of the baryonasymmetry through transport equations. Right-handed electron asymmetry isalmost irrelevant to the baryon asymmetry due to high-scale electroweaksymmetry restoration, leading to both a non-zero baryon asymmetry and theelectron asymmetry. We dub this mechanism as the Eogenesis.",12/5/2024,"['electroweaksymmetry', 'electron', 'electrons', 'thermalequilibrium', 'electroweak']"
Extended Poincare Symmetry Dictates Massive Scattering Amplitudes,"Abstract: We identify an extended Poincare symmetry $ISO(2) \times ISO(3,1)$ foron-shell massive scattering amplitudes, transforming under the $U(2)$ Littlegroup symmetry. Thus the one-particle state involves in both spin andtransversality $t$ (related to chirality), and the spin-spinors are extended tothe spin-transverality spinors. The massive spin-$s$ spinors with differenttransversality can be related by the $SO(5,1)$ symmetry, although the $U(2)$Little group breaks the symmetry explicitly. The three-point massive amplitudescan be fully determined from the $T^\pm$ and $m$ generators, diagrammaticallydenoted as the mass insertion and chirality flip, which provide correspondencebetween massless ultraviolet and massive chiral-eigenstate amplitudes. Thus themassless on-shell technique can be utilized to construct higher-point tree- andloop-level massive amplitudes.",12/4/2024,"['amplitudescan', 'correspondencebetween', 'flip', 'chirality', 'spinors']"
NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82,"Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass oftens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with aLorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV andspread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We useobservations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission toshow that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion massesinto uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavyFIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet coldenough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.",12/4/2024,"['starburst', 'galaxies', 'astrophysical', 'galaxy', 'photon']"
Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions,"Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotationalenergy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via aphenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, thefeeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupledevolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering therate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study ofaxion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time thecoupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit(with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, were-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass blackholes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures haveunderestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by aroundone order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allowsone to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes acrossa much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to beextended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion onthe systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.",12/4/2024,"['astrophysical', 'rotationalenergy', 'quantum', 'bosonic', 'coupledevolution']"
"Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions","Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a ""magnifyingglass"", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, aswell as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection,produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existenceand properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connectedBeyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. Weundertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on theblue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential andthe hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on theaxion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, withdynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects ofvarying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, andthe ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along theway, we explore the ""mirror principle"" induced by the hydrogen burning shelland contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Lessconservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are givenfor a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated ifovershoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the massdistribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using GaiaDR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally,through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes animportant frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties inthe microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.",12/4/2024,"['magnifyingglass', 'blue', 'photon', 'stars', 'stellar']"
Jet EEC aWAKEning: hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere,"Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of highenergy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions wouldprovide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of thebulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium'sback-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations ofasymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal fromother uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limitedtheoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisionsconstrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In thiswork, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect onthe energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the mediumresponse leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law,competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing theassociated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that theobserved large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purelyhydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.",12/4/2024,"['plasma', 'highenergy', 'collisionsconstrains', 'jet', 'quark']"

A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for  centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion  collisions,"Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model forjet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We findthat the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with amodel for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters.This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information fromTRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that theresults are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$,and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-lengthdependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for thedata from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors andperform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for thesystematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and$\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlatederrors.",12/4/2024,"['empirical', 'calibrations', 'jet', 'geometry', '2d']"

Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe,"Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory whichencode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravityis dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs asensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime areconnected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzleof reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, thispuzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists anatural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe.Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in thisway may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can berealized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmativeanswer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuationsof the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the aboveintuition in the quantum regime.",12/4/2024,"['physics', 'spacetime', 'quantum', 'galaxies', 'gravityis']"
Index and localization for type B superconformal mechanics on singular  spaces,"Abstract: Type B superconformal quantum mechanical sigma models are of physicalinterest as they arise in the description of D-brane bound states forming anAdS$_2$ throat. In this work we discuss the applicability of localizationmethods to compute the superconformal index in these theories, despite the factthat their target spaces are generically singular. Similar in spirit to recentworks on type A models, we propose to work on a suitably resolved target spaceto compute a regularized index. While this regularized index correctly capturesthe actual index unambiguously in models of physical interest, we do uncover asubtlety in more pathological examples. This occurs in situations where thesupercharge is not essentially-selfadjoint, in which case the index becomesambiguous and depends on the chosen selfadjoint extension. We also discuss thespecial class of models with K\""ahler target spaces, which can accommodate bothtype A and type B models, and show that the type B index is a particular limitof the type A index. For Calabi-Yau cones, the type B index coincides with theHilbert series of the unresolved space.",12/5/2024,"['physicalinterest', 'quantum', 'theories', 'becomesambiguous', 'factthat']"
On the $1/c$ expansion in $2d$ CFTs with degenerate operators,"Abstract: We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion ofthe Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with externaldegenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgenceproperties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on thecases of four heavy level-two $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptoticseries is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokesline is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we showhow a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoroblock and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show thatforbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and twolight operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, theyare turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptoticexpansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More generalcorrelators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ arebriefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for largeparameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$which can be useful in general.",12/5/2024,"['largeparameters', 'hypergeometric', 'resurgenceproperties', 'expansions', 'large']"

We propose a new assignment of transcendental weight to the numbersthat appear in the amplitude, which leads to a violation of uniformtranscendentality. Furthermore, the machinery of the novel method allows us topropose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion isexpressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmicderivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers.",12/5/2024,"['riemann', 'logarithmicderivatives', 'transcendental', 'superstringtheory', 'novel']"

We discuss how toenforce this boundary condition on an infinite parallel plate in the QED vacuumby introducing Lagrange multiplier fields into the action. We carefullyintroduce appropriate boundary ghosts to maintain BRST invariance. Explicitcorrespondence of this BRST extended theory with the original DEM formulationis discussed, both directly, and through the correspondence between edge modesand Wilson lines attached to the boundary surface. We then use functionalmethods to calculate the Casimir energy for the first time with DEM boundaryconditions imposed on two infinite parallel plates, both in generalized Coulomband linear covariant gauge. Depending on the gauge, different fields arecontributing, but, after correctly implementing the BRST symmetry, we retrievethe exact same Casimir energy as for two perfectly conducting parallel plates.",12/5/2024,"['vacuumby', 'functionalmethods', 'carefullyintroduce', 'toenforce', 'casimir']"
"Squashed 7-spheres, octonions and the swampland","Abstract: The entire eigenvalue spectrum of the operators on the squashed $S^7$ thatappear in the Freund-Rubin compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravitywas recently derived in [1 - 4]. Here we give a brief account of this workwhich started with [1] where the complete spectrum of irreducible isometryrepresentations of the fields in $AdS_4$ was derived for the squashed $S^7$compactification. The operator spectra determine the mass spectrum of thefields in $AdS_4$ and are important for the corresponding $\mathcal{N} =1$supermultiplet structure which appears in two versions depending on the choiceof boundary conditions. By an orientation-flip on the squashed $S^7$ we canalso determine the spectrum of the corresponding non-supersymmetric theory,and, e.g., its spectrum of marginal operators on the boundary of $AdS_4$ whichmay have some relevance for the $AdS$ stability conjecture in the swamplandprogram. The role of singletons is discussed and a possible new Higgsingphenomenon turning them into bulk fields is suggested. Details are here givenprimarily for 2-forms and comments are made on the key role of $G_2$ andoctonions for the structure of the operator equations and mode functions on thesquashed $S^7$.

"Lie, Noether, Kosmann, and Diffeomorphism Anomalies Redux","Abstract: The Noether procedure carries an inherent ambiguity due to the necessarylocal extension, no longer a symmetry, of the global symmetry. The gaugingshould fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, thegeneral covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, withthis alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum$\hat{\mathbbm{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably andshow the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety withthe Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift,often unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\hat{\mathbbm{T}}$again emerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, weaddress how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and showthat the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper {\it must be halved}while the venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected.

Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities,"Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity (QG) amplitudes in fullycompactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-upprediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular,finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable,meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that ofEuclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces tothe condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimplerepresentation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supportedby a wide variety of string theory examples.",12/4/2024,"['supersymmetric', 'quantum', 'theories', 'upprediction', 'gravity']"
Numerical invariants of normed matrix factorizations,"Abstract: We define a normed matrix factorization category and a notion of boundingcochains for objects of this category. We classify bounding cochains up togauge equivalence for spherical objects and use this classification to definenumerical invariants. These invariants are expected to correspond under mirrorsymmetry to the open Gromov-Witten invariants with only boundary constraints ofLagrangian rational cohomology spheres defined by the second author andTukachinsky.For each Delzant polytope, we construct a normed matrix factorizationcategory. For Delzant polytopes satisfying a combinatorial relative spincondition, we construct an object of this category called the Diracfactorization. The Dirac factorization is expected to correspond under mirrorsymmetry to the Lagrangian submanifold given by the real locus of the toricsymplectic manifold associated to the Delzant polytope. In the case of the$n$-simplex for $n$ odd, we show that the Dirac factorization is spherical,mirroring the fact that $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is a rational cohomology sphere. For$n = 1,$ we show the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincidewith the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{R} P^1 \subset \mathbb{C}P^1.$ For $n = 3$ in low degrees, computer calculations verify that thenumerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the openGromov-Witten-Welschinger invariants of $\mathbb{R}P^3 \subset \mathbb{C} P^3.$Although $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is trivial in the Fukaya category of $\mathbb{C} P^n$over any field of characteristic zero, the above results can be seen as amanifestation of mirror symmetry over a Novikov ring.",12/5/2024,"['factorizationcategory', 'cohomology', 'boundingcochains', 'toricsymplectic', 'combinatorial']"

The PT-symmetric properties of $P_{n}(z)$ can becharacterized by two functions, denoted by $s(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$. If the traceof the matrix polynomial is real, then the points at which it can exhibitPT-symmetry are defined by the family of curves $s(x,y)=0$. Additionally, atpoints where the function $h(x,y)\geq 0$, the matrix polynomial exhibitsunbroken PT-symmetry; otherwise, it exhibits broken PT-symmetry. Theintersection points of the curves $s(x,y)=0$ and $h(x,y)=k$, for a given $k\in\mathbb{R}$, are shown to lie on an ellipse, hyperbola, two lines passingthrough the origin, or a straight line, depending on the nature of PT-symmetryof the matrix polynomial.

KdV Equation for Theta Functions on Non-commutative Tori,"Abstract: In the fields of non-commutative geometry and string theory, quantum toriappear in different mathematical and physical contexts. Therefore, quantizedtheta functions defined on quantum tori are also studied (Yu. I. Manin, A.Schwartz; note that a comparison between the two definitions of quantum thetais still an open problem). One important application of classical thetafunctions is in soliton theory. Certain soliton equations, including the KdVequation, have algebro-geometric solutions that are given by theta functions(we refer to F. Gesztesy and H. Holden), and as such belong to an ""integrablehierarchy."" While quantized integrability is a very active and complicatedsubject, in this work we take a different, naive approach. We conduct anexperiment: using a definition of differentiation on quantum tori (M. Rieffel),we ask whether the quantum theta function satisfies non-linear PDE. Theexperiment is successful on the 2-torus and for the KdV equation. This opensthe way to future investigations, such as the quest for a compatible hierarchysatisfied by quantum theta, and a consistent definition of completeintegrability.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'mathematical', 'equations', 'complicatedsubject', 'toriappear']"
Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian  systems,"Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence inHamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions andthe corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The firstcascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recentlyuncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed,leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration ofenergy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of apower-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and theformation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach twodifferent types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cuspin the other.

From Magic State Distillation to Dynamical Systems,"Abstract: Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerantquantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantumadvantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizercodes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols thatdon't fall into this class. We propose a method to map MSD protocols toiterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. Withour mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols usingtechniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillationprocess of input states under arbitrary noise model and visualize it using flowdiagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state andfind some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill statescorresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill themagic state for corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exoticMSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys.J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. Wealso study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes andnumerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols withvarious magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, wecan reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposedmethod will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols forcanonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocolsfor other states.",12/5/2024,"['quantumadvantage', 'usingtechniques', 'magic', 'distillationprocess', 'research']"
On the Replica Symmetry of a Variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin  Glass,"Abstract: We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\in (-1,1)$ whose interactionsare described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quarticcorrection. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \cite{Bolt2} asa toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used toderive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if$m\neq 0$. In \cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of thede Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is\begin{equation}\label{eq:conj} \beta^2(1-m^2)^2\leq 1. \, \, \, \, \, \, \,\, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, (1)\end{equation} Here, $\beta \geq 0$corresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method impliesreplica symmetry for $\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that themethod fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). Anatural question that was left open in \cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctlycharacterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, weshow that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \geq m_*$, forsome $m_* \in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative forsuitable $\beta $ that satisfy (1).",12/5/2024,"['hamiltonian', 'bolthausen', 'bolt2', 'quarticcorrection', 'weshow']"
Super-Poissonian Squeezed Light in the Deep Strong Regime of the Quantum  Rabi Model,"Abstract: By analytically solving the quantum Rabi model, we investigate the photonicproperties of its ground eigenstate. In particular, we find that in the deepstrong coupling regime, where the coupling strength $g$ exceeds the modefrequency $\omega$, the photonic state is effectively squeezed in one of itsquadratures. The squeezing reaches its maximum at the curve corresponding tothe quantum phase transition of the quantum Rabi system, and decreases rapidlyon both sides of the phase transition. Notably, for $g/\omega\approx 3$, whichis experimentally testable in existing trapped-ion platforms, the achievablesqueezing parameter can reach approximately $r\approx 0.8$. Intriguingly, thephotonic state is squeezed while its number distribution follows asuper-Poissonian distribution, with the largest deviation from Poissonianbehavior occurring at the phase transition between the normal and superradiantphases. In other words, the ground state of the quantum Rabi model containssuper-Poissonian quantum squeezed photons.",12/5/2024,"['photonicproperties', 'quantum', 'thephotonic', 'eigenstate', 'superradiantphases']"
On the role of the unitary transformations in Bell inequalities,"Abstract: The role of the unitary transformations in the Bell-CHSH inequality ishighlighted, in both Quantum Mechanics and relativistic Quantum Field Theory.In the former case, we discuss, through a few examples, how the violation ofthe Bell-CHSH inequality can be encoded into unitary transformations acting ona given reference set of Bell's observables. In the latter case, the Bell-CHSHinequality for a real massive scalar field in the vacuum state is considered.After introducing suitable bounded Hermitian operators, we show that usingunitary transformations can significantly improve our previous numericalalgorithm, leading to an increase in the size of the violation.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'relativistic', 'usingunitary', 'numericalalgorithm', 'hermitian']"
Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility,"Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- ametallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-siteCoulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional(1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable modelon a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion isshown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediateferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrastto the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any dopedelectron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore variousmicroscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting twoexamples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model andvacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate anintriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions ofthese models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallicphase.",12/4/2024,"['ferromagnetism', 'fermionic', 'ferromagnet', 'electrons', 'dopedelectron']"
Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial  polycrystalline materials,"Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxialpolycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity,diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjesintegral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint randomoperators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representationsof physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electricfield $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated withconductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity$\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrixanalysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory.We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric randommatrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discreteresolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involvingthe matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and$\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for thecomponents of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices,$\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measuresfor the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms oftheir real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projectionmethod that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that thespectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to amore efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulktransport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm bynumerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.",12/4/2024,"['eigenvectors', 'uniaxialpolycrystalline', 'eigenvalues', 'eigenvector', 'matrixanalysis']"

Application of the Direct Interaction Approximation to generalized  stochastic models in the turbulence problem,"Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to consider the application of the directinteraction approximation (DIA) developed by Kraichnan to generalizedstochastic models in the turbulence problem. Previous developments (Kraichnan,Shivamoggi et al., Shivamoggi and Tuovila) were based on the Boltzmann-Gibbsprescription for the underlying entropy measure, which exhibits the extensivityproperty and is suited for ergodic systems. Here, we consider the introductionof an influence bias discriminating rare and frequent events explicitly, asbehooves non-ergodic systems. More specifically, we consider the application ofthe DIA to a linear damped stochastic oscillator system using a Tsallis typeautocorrelation model with an underlying non-extensive entropy measure, anddescribe the resulting stochastic process.

Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions  returned by stable algorithms,"Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shatteringtakes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p},\sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Ofspecial interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large$p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamicaltransition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a`soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of adistance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbsmeasure. We further show that this latter property implies that stablealgorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined toan exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that theirsuccess probability is not vanishingly small.",12/4/2024,"['physics', 'gibbsmeasure', 'beta', 'stablealgorithms', 'shatteringtakes']"
Large spin measurements in an arbitrary two-qudit state,"Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used inmany quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for themaximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin measurements isstill known only in a two-qubit case. In the present article, for a two-quditstate of an arbitrary dimension $d=2s+1\geq2$, we introduce the notion of thespin-$s$ correlation matrix, having dimension $3\times3$ for all $d\geq2$;establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive interms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression forthe maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin-$s$measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for thetwo-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state and some nonseparablepure two-qudit states, we find that, under large spin ($s\geq1$) measurementsin each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one,the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSHinequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases with agrowth of its entanglement degree, the situation under large spin measurementsis quite different --for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree ofentanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be lessthan for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for aseparable one.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'times3', 'matrix', 'geq2', 'ghz']"
Quiescent Big Bang formation in $2+1$ dimensions,"Abstract: In this paper, we study the past asymptotics of $(2+1)$-dimensional solutionsto the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system which are close toFriedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes on an initial hypersurfacediffeomorphic to a closed orientable surface $M$ of arbitrary genus. We provethat such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibitstable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular,they are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics becomeincomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptoticallyvelocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their backgroundcounterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropicbackground solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approachesa smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previousresults in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasovequations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori createsadditional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main resultshows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized$U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from aspatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1$.",12/4/2024,"['einstein', 'hypersurfacediffeomorphic', 'spacetimes', 'mathbb', 'isotropicbackground']"
Optimal estimation of three parallel spins with genuine and restricted  collective measurements,"Abstract: Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems areadvantageous in information extraction than individual measurements. However,little is known about the distinction between restricted collectivemeasurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting.In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and oldestimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallelspins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimationfidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuinecollective measurements. Moreover, we show that this estimation fidelity can beachieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication inone direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape ofmultipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum statesand is expected to trigger further studies.",12/4/2024,"['quantum', 'estimationfidelity', 'multipartite', 'oldestimation', 'collectivemeasurements']"
TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving  wall,"Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on$\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically movingwall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express theone-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with stepinitial condition along a space-like path.Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the modelunder various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initialcondition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of theregion influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in[Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, wedemonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in themacroscopic empirical density.As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expressionfor the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusingon non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrarydensity, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limitdistribution within the framework of particle positions.",12/4/2024,"['mathbb', 'empirical', 'themacroscopic', 'limitdistribution', 'asymptotics']"
Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps  Equation with Rational Data,"Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T)\times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the globalexistence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data$\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates globalwell-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space$\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove solitonresolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniformbounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s > 0$.Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equationon Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending theseresults, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data in ageneralized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spacesin complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includesthe complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong\mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target$\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.",12/4/2024,"['mathbf', 'mathbb', 'equations', 'globalwell', 'spacesin']"

Oscillatory Instabilities of a One-Spot Pattern in the Schnakenberg  Reaction-Diffusion System in $3$-D Domains,"Abstract: For an activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system in a boundedthree-dimensional domain $\Omega$ of $O(1)$ volume and small activatordiffusivity of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, we employ a hybrid asymptotic-numericalmethod to investigate two instabilities of a localized one-spot equilibriumthat result from Hopf bifurcations: an amplitude instability leading to growingoscillations in spot amplitude, and a translational instability leading togrowing oscillations of the location of the spot's center $\mathbf{x}_0 \in\Omega$. Here, a one-spot equilibrium is one in which the activatorconcentration is exponentially small everywhere in $\Omega$ except in alocalized region of $O(\varepsilon)$ about $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \Omega$ where itsconcentration is $O(1)$. We find that the translation instability is governedby a $3\times 3$ nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem. The entries of thismatrix involve terms calculated from certain Green's functions, which encodeinformation about the domain's geometry. In this nonlinear matrix eigenvaluesystem, the most unstable eigenvalue determines the oscillation frequency atonset, while the corresponding eigenvector determines the direction ofoscillation. We demonstrate the impact of domain geometry and defects on thisinstability, providing analytic insights into how they select the preferreddirection of oscillation. For the amplitude instability, we illustrate theintricate way in which the Hopf bifurcation threshold $\tau_H$ varies with afeed-rate parameter $A$. In particular, we show that the $\tau_H$ versus $A$relationship possesses two saddle-nodes, with different branches scalingdifferently with the small parameter $\varepsilon$. All asymptotic results areconfirmed by finite elements solutions of the full reaction-diffusion system.",12/5/2024,"['eigenvaluesystem', 'numericalmethod', 'eigenvalue', 'eigenvector', 'translational']"
Bloch Oscillations of a Soliton in a 1D Quantum Fluid,"Abstract: The motion of a quantum system subjected to an external force often defeatsour classical intuition. A celebrated example is the dynamics of a singleparticle in a periodic potential, which undergoes Bloch oscillations under theaction of a constant force. Surprisingly, Bloch-like oscillations can alsooccur in one-dimensional quantum fluids without requiring the presence of alattice. The intriguing generalization of Bloch oscillations to aweakly-bounded ensemble of interacting particles has been so far limited to theexperimental study of the two-particle case, where the observed period ishalved compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we observe theoscillations of the position of a mesoscopic solitonic wave packet, consistingof approximately 1000 atoms in a one-dimensional Bose gas when subjected to aconstant uniform force and in the absence of a lattice potential. Theoscillation period scales inversely with the atom number, thus revealing itscollective nature. We demonstrate the pivotal role of the phase coherence ofthe quantum bath in which the wave packet moves and investigate the underlyingtopology of the associated superfluid currents. Our measurements highlight theperiodicity of the dispersion relation of collective excitations inone-dimensional quantum systems. We anticipate that our observation of such amacroscopic quantum phenomenon will inspire further studies on the crossoverbetween classical and quantum laws of motion, such as exploring the role ofdissipation, similarly to the textbook case of macroscopic quantum tunneling inJosephson physics.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'physics', 'theexperimental', 'theperiodicity', 'mesoscopic']"
Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum  systems,"Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstableperiodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for aparticle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times.Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, anda question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here,we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of alocalized wavepacket in phase space leaves a ""quantum trail"" on theeigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectoriesin phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkabledynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, thelong-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory,which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition forthese effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarpingprocedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space ofthe page.",12/5/2024,"['unstableperiodic', 'unstable', 'quantum', 'scars', 'wavefunction']"
Energy Scalability Limits of Dissipative Solitons,"Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primaryconstraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on theadiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling interms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentallyverifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzianspike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectralcondensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrumbroadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakupwith three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherentin strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, whichprovokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase,which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiplestable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitativeagreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnSchirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energyfemtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiberlasers.",12/5/2024,"['thermodynamical', 'spectralcondensation', 'einstein', 'lorentzianspike', 'energyfemtosecond']"
Revealing Physical Mechanisms of pattern formation and switching in  ecosystems via Landscape and Flux,"Abstract: Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium naturalsystems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, therebyexhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems suchas embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However,how the pattern formation emerges and how the pattern switching occurs are notfully understood. Here, we developed a landscape-flux field theory via thespatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism ofthe pattern formation and switching. We identified the landscape and flux fieldas the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to thecritical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-aridecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives transitions ofspatial patterns. We uncovered how the pattern switching emerges through theoptimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching.Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibitpeaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical andthermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering earlywarning signals for anticipating pattern switching. Our work thus revealsphysical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and,more generally, introduces an useful approach for quantifying spatial patternswitching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practicalapplications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatialpatterns.",12/5/2024,"['patternswitching', 'aridecosystems', 'turbulence', 'expansion', 'complex']"

Interaction of jamitons in second-order macroscopic traffic models,"Abstract: Jamitons are self-sustained traveling wave solutions that arise in certainsecond-order macroscopic models of vehicular traffic. A necessary condition fora jamiton to appear is that the local traffic density breaks the so-calledsub-characteristic condition. This condition states that the characteristicvelocity of the corresponding first-order Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR)model formed with the same desired speed function is enclosed by thecharacteristic speeds of the corresponding second-order model. The phenomenonof collision of jamitons in second-order models of traffic flow is studiedanalytically and numerically for the particular case of the second-orderAw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model [A.\ Aw, M.\ Rascle, {\it SIAM J.\ Appl.\Math.} {\bf 60} (2000) 916--938; H.\ M.\ Zhang, {\it Transp.\ Res.\ B} {\bf 36}(2002) 275--290]. A compatibility condition is first defined to select jamitonsthat can collide each other. The collision of jamitons produces a new jamitonwith a velocity different from the initial ones. It is observed that the exitvelocities smooth out the velocity of the test jamiton and the initialvelocities of the jamitons that collide. Other properties such as the amplitudeof the exit jamitons, lengths, and maximum density are also explored.In thecases of the amplitude and maximum exit density it turns out that over a widerange of sonic densities, the exit values exceed or equal the input values. Onthe other hand, the resulting jamiton has a greater length than the incomingones. Finally, the behavior for various driver reaction times is explored. Itis obtained that some properties do not depend on that time, such as theamplitude, exit velocity, or maximum density, while the exit length does dependon driver reaction time.",12/4/2024,"['exitvelocities', 'collision', 'traffic', 'collide', 'studiedanalytically']"

Online Physics-Informed Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and  Applications,"Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has received increasing research attentiondue to its capability to analyze and model complex dynamical systems. However,it faces challenges in computational efficiency, noise sensitivity, anddifficulty adhering to physical laws, which negatively affect its performance.Addressing these issues, we present Online Physics-informed DMD (OPIDMD), anovel adaptation of DMD into a convex optimization framework. This approach notonly ensures convergence to a unique global optimum, but also enhances theefficiency and accuracy of modeling dynamical systems in an online setting.Leveraging the Bayesian DMD framework, we propose a probabilisticinterpretation of Physics-informed DMD (piDMD), examining the impact ofphysical constraints on the DMD linear operator. Further, we implement onlineproximal gradient descent and formulate specific algorithms to tackle problemswith different physical constraints, enabling real-time solutions acrossvarious scenarios. Compared with existing algorithms such as Exact DMD, OnlineDMD, and piDMD, OPIDMD achieves the best prediction performance in short-termforecasting, e.g. an $R^2$ value of 0.991 for noisy Lorenz system.

TRENDy: Temporal Regression of Effective Non-linear Dynamics,"Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogendynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein wavescontrolling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding howcontrollable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior calledbifurcations. This endeavor is made particularly difficult in realisticsettings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown anddata is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy(Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-freeapproach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporaldynamics. Following classical work in spatial coarse-graining, TRENDy firstmaps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics via a cascadeof multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition thatthese effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation(NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The precedingfiltering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, makingTRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. Wetrain TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real datarepresenting dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We thendemonstrate how our framework can automatically locate both Turing and Hopfbifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our methodto the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard throughdevelopment. We found that TRENDy's effective state not only accuratelypredicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct patternfeatures unique to different anatomical regions, highlighting the potentialinfluence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their rolein driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.",12/4/2024,"['spatiotemporaldynamics', 'morphogendynamics', 'wavescontrolling', 'howcontrollable', 'nonlinear']"
Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. I: Conservation  Laws and Systems with Two Independent Variables,"Abstract: For a system of partial differential equations that has an extendedKovalevskaya form, a reduction procedure is presented that allows one to use alocal (point, contact, or higher) symmetry of a system and a symmetry-invariantconservation law to algorithmically calculate constants of motion holding forsymmetry-invariant solutions.

Stagnation points at grain contacts generate an elastic flow instability  in 3D porous media,"Abstract: Many environmental, energy, and industrial processes involve the flow ofpolymer solutions in three-dimensional (3D) porous media where fluid isconfined to navigate through complex pore space geometries. As polymers aretransported through the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses accumulate,leading to the onset of unsteady flow fluctuations above a threshold flow rate.How does pore space geometry influence the development and features of thiselastic instability? Here, we address this question by directly imaging polymersolution flow in microfabricated 3D ordered porous media with preciselycontrolled geometries consisting of simple-cubic (SC) or body-centered cuboid(BC) arrays of spherical grains. In both cases, we find that the flowinstability is generated at stagnation points arising at the contacts betweengrains rather than at the polar upstream/downstream grain surfaces, as is thecase for flow around a single grain. The characteristics of the flowinstability are strongly dependent on the unit cell geometry: in SC packings,the instability manifests through the formation of time-dependent, fluctuating3D eddies, whereas in BC packings, it manifests as continual fluctuating'wobbles' and crossing in the flow pathlines. Despite this difference, we findthat characteristics of the transition from steady to unsteady flow withincreasing flow rate have commonalities across geometries. Moreover, for bothpacking geometries, our data indicate that extensional flow-induced polymericstresses generated by contact-associated stagnation points are the primarycontributor to the macroscopic resistance to flow across the entire medium.Altogether, our work highlights the pivotal role of inter-grain contacts --which are typically idealized as discrete points and therefore overlooked, butare inherent in most natural and engineered media -- in shaping elasticinstabilities in porous media.",12/4/2024,"['polymersolution', 'polymericstresses', 'fluctuating3d', 'porous', 'elasticinstabilities']"
"Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem","Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is toproduce coherent decisions that solve societal challenges while respecting thewill of the people they represent. New governance frameworks represent thisproblem as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid withcentralized authority. But how should this network be structured? Toinvestigate this question, we model the set of decisions a population must makeas a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved indecision-making as a social hypergraph. This allows us to consider the benefitsof different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Inbetween these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where decisiongroups are formed as needed by key stakeholders to discuss and make specificdecisions. This regime of effective governance allows even incoherent orpolarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs.More broadly, we present not just simulation results, but a modeling frameworkthat can be used to explore the costs and benefits of a wide range ofgovernance strategies using bottom-up approaches and their ability to tackledecision problems that challenge standard governments.",12/4/2024,"['democracy', 'democratic', 'decisiongroups', 'governance', 'specificdecisions']"
Reconstruction of dynamic systems using genetic algorithms with dynamic  search limits,"Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for describing, predicting, andunderstanding complex phenomena exhibited by real-world systems. However,identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimentaldata remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In thisstudy, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate thegoverning equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The mainapproach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, andsubsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some ofthe main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of thegenetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanismto escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, weapplied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, andthe Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an IntegralSquare Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamicequations.",12/3/2024,"['algorithms', 'mathematical', 'polynomial', 'algorithm', 'genetic']"

Bifurcation analysis of quasi-periodic orbits of mechanical systems with  1:2 internal resonance via spectral submanifolds,"Abstract: A 1:2 internally resonant mechanical system can undergo secondary Hopf(Neimark-Sacker) bifurcations, resulting in a quasi-periodic response when thesystem is subject to harmonic excitation. While these quasi-periodic orbitshave been observed in practice, their bifurcations are not well studied,especially in high-dimensional mechanical systems. This is mainly because ofthe challenges associated with the computation and bifurcation detection ofthese quasi-periodic motions. Here we present a computational framework toaddress these challenges via reductions on spectral submanifolds, whichtransforms quasi-periodic orbits of high-dimensional systems as limit cycles offour-dimensional reduced-order models. We apply the proposed framework toanalyze bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits in several mechanical systemsexhibiting 1:2 internal resonance, including a finite element model of ashallow-curved shell. We uncover local bifurcations such as period-doubling andsaddle-node, as well as global bifurcations such as homoclinic connections,isolas, and simple bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits. We also observecascades of period-doubling bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits thateventually result in chaotic motions, as well as the coexistence of chaotic andquasi-periodic attractors. These findings elucidate the complex bifurcationmechanism of quasi-periodic orbits in 1:2 internally resonant systems.",12/3/2024,"['chaotic', 'systemsexhibiting', 'complex', 'challenges', 'computational']"
Pseudo-Bifurcations in Stochastic Non-Normal Systems,"Abstract: We challenge the prevailing emphasis on bifurcations as the primary mechanismbehind many abrupt changes in complex systems and propose an alternative, moreuniversally applicable explanation based on non-normal dynamics. We demonstratethat linear or approximately linear stochastic systems near a dynamicalattractor exhibit transient repulsive dynamics - termed pseudo-bifurcations -when interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchicallyorganized, i.e., non-normal. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warningsignals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, criticalslowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that, as actualbifurcations approach, non-normal transients also emerge, complicating theirdistinction and potentially creating a bias that suggests the system is muchcloser to a critical point than it actually is. We support our analyticalderivations by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs ofsuch non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected ofapproaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normaldynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena acrossnatural, physical, and social systems.",11/16/2024,"['actualbifurcations', 'dynamicalattractor', 'moreuniversally', 'hierarchicallyorganized', 'stochastic']"
"Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality","Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on theEuclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that$G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere$SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up theway for applications of such ans\""atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrmetheory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction isbased on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehatK}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such amathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a waythat makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological(homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct firstorder partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutionsalso solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic mapenergy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturatea lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitutethe Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constituteharmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of therational map ans\""atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$.",12/3/2024,"['mathematical', 'mathbb', 'riemann', 'mapenergy', 'hermitian']"

Introducing a long external feedbackloop with time delays comparable to the microcavity photon lifetime but shorterthan thermal relaxation timescales, reveals how delay affects excitability andstabilizes temporal localized states.

Voter demographics and socio-economic factors in kinetic models for  opinion formation,"Abstract: Voter demographics and socio-economic factors like age, sex, ethnicity,education level, income, and other measurable factors like behaviour inprevious elections or referenda are of key importance in modelling opinionformation dynamics. Here, we revisit the kinetic opinion formation model fromD\""uring and Wright (2022) and compare in more detail the influence ofdifferent choices of characteristic demographic factors and initial conditions.The model is based on the kinetic opinion formation model by Toscani (2006) andthe leader-follower model of D\""uring et al.

Synchronization transitions in adaptive simplicial complexes with  cooperative and competitive dynamics,"Abstract: Adaptive network is a powerful presentation to describe different real-worldphenomena. However, current models often neglect higher-order interactions(beyond pairwise interactions) and diverse adaptation types (cooperative andcompetitive) commonly observed in systems like the human brain and socialnetworks. This work addresses this gap by incorporating these factors into amodel that explores their impact on collective properties like synchronization.Through simplified network representations, we investigate how the simultaneouspresence of cooperative and competitive adaptations influences phasetransitions. Our findings reveal a transition from first-order to second-ordersynchronization as the strength of higher-order interactions increases undercompetitive adaptation. We also demonstrate the possibility of synchronizationeven without pairwise interactions, provided there is strong enoughhigher-order coupling. When only competitive adaptations are present, thesystem exhibits second-order-like phase transitions and clustering. Conversely,with a combination of cooperative and competitive adaptations, the systemundergoes a first-order-like phase transition, characterized by a sharptransition to the synchronized state without reverting to an incoherent stateduring backward transitions. The specific nature of these second-order-liketransitions varies depending on the coupling strengths and mean degrees. Withour model, we can control not only when the system synchronizes but also theway the system goes to synchronization.",12/2/2024,"['ordersynchronization', 'socialnetworks', 'phasetransitions', 'worldphenomena', 'adaptive']"
Classifying pedestrian crossing flows: A data-driven approach using  fundamental diagrams and machine learning,"Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of pedestrian crossing flows withvarying crossing angles $\alpha$ to classify different scenarios and deriveimplications for crowd management. Probability density functions of four keyfeatures$-$velocity $v$, density $\rho$, avoidance number $Av$, and intrusionnumber $In$$-$were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior.Velocity-density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each $\alpha$ andfitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attemptsusing $Av$-$In$ and $v$-$\rho$ phase spaces revealed significant overlaps,highlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenariodifferentiation. To address this, machine learning models, including logisticregression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Resultsshowed robust classification performance, with $v$ and $Av$ contributing mostsignificantly. Insights from feature importance metrics and classificationaccuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizingpedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces. These findings provide adata-driven framework for advancing pedestrian dynamics research.",12/2/2024,"['scenariodifferentiation', 'optimizingpedestrian', 'logisticregression', 'classificationaccuracy', 'pedestrian']"
A strategy to control synchronized dynamics in swarmalator systems,"Abstract: Synchronization forms the basis of many coordination phenomena in naturalsystems, enabling them to function cohesively and support their fundamentaloperations. However, there are scenarios where synchronization disrupts asystem's proper functioning, necessitating mechanisms to control or suppressit. While several methods exist for controlling synchronization innon-spatially embedded oscillators, to the best of our knowledge no suchstrategies have been developed for swarmalators (oscillators thatsimultaneously move in space and synchronize in time). In this work, we addressthis gap by introducing a novel control strategy based on Hamiltonian controltheory to suppress synchronization in a system of swarmalators confined to aone-dimensional space. The numerical investigations we performed, demonstratethat the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamicswithin the swarmalator population. We studied the impact of the number ofcontrolled swarmalators as well as the strength of the control term, in itsoriginal form and in a simplified one.",11/29/2024,"['swarmalators', 'swarmalator', 'space', 'oscillators', 'naturalsystems']"
Collective decision-making with heterogeneous biases: Role of network  topology and susceptibility,"Abstract: The ability of groups to make accurate collective decisions depends on acomplex interplay of various factors, such as prior information, biases, socialinfluence, and the structure of the interaction network. Here, we investigate aspin model that accounts for heterogeneous preferences and enables control overthe non-linearity of social interactions. Building on previous results forcomplete graphs and regular 2D lattices, we investigate how the modification ofnetwork topology towards (sparse) random graphs can affect collectivedecision-making. We use two different measures of susceptibility to assess theresponsiveness of the system to internal and external perturbations. Inparticular, we investigate how the maximum of susceptibility depends on networkconnectivity. Based on our findings, we discuss how collective systems mightadapt to changes in environmental fluctuations by adjusting their networkstructure or the nature of their social interactions in order to remain in theregion of maximal susceptibility.",11/29/2024,"['networkconnectivity', 'socialinfluence', 'collectivedecision', 'networkstructure', 'factors']"
Deterministic many-body dynamics with multifractal response,"Abstract: Dynamical systems can display a plethora of ergodic and ergodicity breakingbehaviors, ranging from simple periodicity to ergodicity and chaos.

Thisphenomenon is observed in the momentum-conserving variant of the newlyintroduced class of the so-called parity check reversible cellular automata,which we define with respect to an arbitrary bi-partite lattice.

Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCA): Reversibility and  Cyclic behavior,"Abstract: In this work, we propose a variant of non-uniform cellular automata, named asTemporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCAs), which temporally use tworules, $f$ and $g$ in a sequence $\mathcal{R}$. To observe reversibility int-NUCAs, we study their injectivity and surjectivity properties. Unlikeclassical CAs, some irreversible t-NUCAs show the behavior similar toreversible t-NUCAs. To study this behavior, we define restricted surjectivityof t-NUCA and introduce restricted reversibility which shows reversibility oft-NUCA for a set of initial configurations. By further investigating theremaining irreversible t-NUCAs, some t-NUCAs are found which have many-to-onemapping in their configuration space, but do not have non-reachable(Garden-of-Eden) configurations. We name these t-NUCAs as weakly reversiblet-NUCAs. Under finite lattice size, a t-NUCA, like any classical CA, showscyclic behavior. We explore this cyclic behavior and discuss its relation withrule sequence. Finally, we note down the possible longest cycle length of at-NUCA, based on the lattice size and rule sequence.",11/26/2024,"['automata', 'mathcal', 'tworules', 'cellular', 'variant']"

One-dimensional cellular automata with a unique active transition,"Abstract: A one-dimensional cellular automaton $\tau : A^\mathbb{Z} \to A^\mathbb{Z}$is a transformation of the full shift defined via a finite neighborhood $S\subset \mathbb{Z}$ and a local function $\mu : A^S \to A$. We study the familyof cellular automata whose finite neighborhood $S$ is an interval containing$0$, and there exists a pattern $p \in A^S$ satisfying that $\mu(z) = z(0)$ ifand only if $z \neq p$; this means that these cellular automata have a unique\emph{active transition}. Despite its simplicity, this family presentsinteresting and subtle problems, as the behavior of the cellular automatoncompletely depends on the structure of $p$. We show that every cellularautomaton $\tau$ with a unique active transition $p \in A^S$ is eitheridempotent or strictly almost equicontinuous, and we completely characterizeeach one of these situations in terms of $p$. In essence, the idempotence of$\tau$ depends on the existence of a certain subpattern of $p$ with atranslational symmetry.",11/6/2024,"['mathbb', 'cellularautomaton', 'automata', 'automatoncompletely', 'automaton']"
Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven  dipole-conserving spin chain,"Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structuredergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems.

By tuning the relative pump and loss and how localthe constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiselesssubsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve largeamounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppressescurrent in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert spacehold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism.

Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System  Identification,"Abstract: Invariant measures are widely used to compare chaotic dynamical systems, asthey offer robustness to noisy data, uncertain initial conditions, andirregular sampling. However, large classes of systems with distinct transientdynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, whichposes challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform systemidentification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we proposestudying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhancedsensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that asingle invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to performsystem identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result alreadysurpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original statecoordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminateall ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique systemidentification can be achieved using additional invariant measures intime-delay coordinates constructed from different observables.

Lyapunov stability under $q$-dilatation and $q$-contraction of  coordinates,"Abstract: This study examines the Lyapunov stability under coordinate $q$-contractionand $q$-dilatation in three dynamical systems: the discrete-time dissipativeH\'enon map, and the conservative, non-integrable, continuous-timeH\'enon-Heiles and diamagnetic Kepler problems. The stability analysis uses the$q$-deformed Jacobian and $q$-derivative, with trajectory stability assessedfor $q > 1$ (dilatation) and $q < 1$ (contraction). Analytical curves in theparameter space mark boundaries of distinct low-periodic motions in the H\'enonmap. Numerical simulations compute the maximal Lyapunov exponent across theparameter space, in Poincar\'e surfaces of section, and as a function of totalenergy in the conservative systems. Simulations show that $q$-contraction($q$-dilatation) generally decreases (increases) positive Lyapunov exponentsrelative to the $q = 1$ case, while both transformations tend to increaseLyapunov exponents for regular orbits.

Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,"Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using highfidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more ondata driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited trainingdata, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states overtime and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken usingdata assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically requireknowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In thispaper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation intopological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions ofpersistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topologicaldifferences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data drivenmodel coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. Wedescribe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaoticLorenz system as an example.",11/12/2024,"['drivenmodel', 'intopological', 'chaoticlorenz', 'highfidelity', 'physics']"
Simulating phase inversion processes by coupled map lattice: Towards the  theoretical design of food texture and quality in dairy processing from fresh  cream to butter via whipped cream,"Abstract: We present a theoretical model and simulation for the formation dynamics ofdiverse texture patterns that emerge spontaneously or self-organize duringphase inversion processes of fresh cream by mechanical whipping. The resultssuggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing thetexture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modelingcomplexity in phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream tobutter was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach,coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set ofprocedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), whipping, coalescence, andflocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables,surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined ona two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known anddifferent phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whippingtemperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processesare at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. Wecharacterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as theviscosity dominance at high whipping temperature and as the overrun dominanceat low whipping temperature on the viscosity-overrun plane, which is one of thestate diagrams.",11/29/2024,"['cream', 'butter', 'coalescence', 'resultssuggest', 'modelingcomplexity']"
Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the  edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire,"Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competeswith the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a singlespin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire wherespin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting)mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivityleads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, thereis a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity\textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale isdynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength arecomparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens theimpurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgapstate is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entirephase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconductinginteraction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength,the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSRphases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens theimpurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in thethermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competitionbetween different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipativeKondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impuritycoupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensationcompetes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff andthe bulk spin interaction compete with screening.",12/2/2024,"['superconductivityleads', 'superconductinginteraction', 'fermions', 'quantum', 'superconducting']"
Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili  equations,"Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a`lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directlylinearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions ofthe non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensionalgeneralisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKPequation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of thosefor the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We alsopresent the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of thesenon-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrabilityresults, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKPequations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real linegenerated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised formof the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product,based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe forthe commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing aparticular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra.

We show that the exponentialdouble-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum,whereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalueson the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves thelong-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in thespectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain theexponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with thereflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in eachquadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, weconsider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degeneratesinto a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.",12/1/2024,"['riemann', 'eigenvalues', 'laboratory', 'eigenvalueson', 'algebraic']"
Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe  wavefunctions,"Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethewavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1dlattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunctioninto a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethewavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always bewritten as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions,where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Buildingupon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor networkrepresentations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planartree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and aregular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree,the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptivequantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on$2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministicallyprepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class ofgeneralized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensornetwork and quantum circuit representations are also possible.",12/1/2024,"['tensornetwork', 'wavefunctioninto', '1dlattice', 'multipartite', 'quantum']"

Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations with  delay,"Abstract: For the first time, Schr\""odinger equations with cubic and more complexnonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay areanalyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of adelay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed.One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studiedpartial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differentialequations and ordinary differential equations with delay.

Analyzing lump-type solutions in scalar field models through  configurational information measure,"Abstract: In this paper we employ a configurational information measure, specificallythe differential configurational complexity (DCC), to quantify the informationcontent of lump-type solutions in various scalar field models, including twomodified inverted $\phi^{4}$ models, the modified $\phi^{3}$ model, as well astwo additional families of lump models. Our objective is to complement previousstudies by providing an informational perspective that distinguishes differentsolutions based on their energy configurations. We explore how the DCC measurerelates to energy and its applicability in analyzing degenerate states.

On a countable sequence of homoclinic orbits arising near a  saddle-center point,Abstract: Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbationtheory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center pointand to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long agothat the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter valuesif there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extensionof the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof ofthis conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to thetraveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with thefifth-order dispersion term.,12/2/2024,"['conjectured', 'conjecture', 'fourth', 'analytic', 'quadruplet']"
Prediction and observation of topological modes in fractal nonlinear  optics,"Abstract: This item from the News & Views category, to be published in Light: Science &Applications, aims to provide a summary of theoretical and experimental resultsrecently published in Ref. [24], which demonstrate the creation of corner modesin nonlinear optical waveguides of the higher-order topological-insulator(HOTI) type. Actually, these are second-order HOTIs, in which the transversedimension of the topologically protected edge modes is smaller than the bulkdimension (it is 2, in the case of optical waveguide) by 2, implying zerodimension of the protected modes, that are actually realized as corner ordefect ones. Work [24] reports prediction and creation of various forms of thecorner modes in a HOTI with a fractal transverse structure, represented by theSierpinski gasket (SG). The self-focusing nonlinearity of the waveguide'smaterial transforms the corner modes into corner solitons, almost all of whichare stable. The solitons may be attached to external or internal cornerscreated by the underlying SG. This N&V item offers an overview of these newfindings reported in Ref.

Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus  angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum,"Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments isstill a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yieldratios (IYR), \textit{i.e.} the relative population of two or more long-livedmetastable states with different spins, of fission products.We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-inducedfission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University ofJyv{\""a}skyl{\""a}. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are$^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-inducedfission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significantlarger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compoundnucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), withaverage spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data ofIYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR areindependent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYRmust be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FFangular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is inaddition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.",12/5/2024,"['neutron', 'fission', 'fissioning', 'isotopes', 'university']"
Beta delayed neutron emission of $N=84$ $^{132}$Cd,"Abstract: Using the time-of-flight technique, we measured the beta-delayed neutronemission of $^{132}$Cd. From our large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculationusing the N$^3$LO interaction [Z.Y. Xu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 022501(2023)], we suggest the decay is dominated by the transformation of a neutronin the $g_{7/2}$ orbital, deep below the Fermi surface, into a proton in the$g_{9/2}$ orbital. We compare the beta-decay half-lives and neutron branchingratios of nuclei with $Z<50$ and $N\geq82$ obtained with our LSSM with those ofleading ""global"" models. Our calculations match known half-lives and neutronbranching ratios well and suggest that current leading models overestimate theyet-to-be-measured half-lives. Our model, backed by the $^{132}$Cd decay datapresented here, offers robust predictive power for nuclei of astrophysicalinterest such as $r$-process waiting points.",12/5/2024,"['neutronbranching', 'neutronemission', 'neutron', 'neutronin', 'fermi']"

Spin distribution of fission fragments involving bending and wriggling  modes,"Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical description of the spin distributions offragments from low-energy induced and spontaneous nuclear fission, expressed inan analytical form. The mechanism of pumping high spin values for deformedfission fragments is explained. The idea is that the source of the generationof high relative orbital moments and spins of the fragments are the transversewriggling and bending vibrations of the pre-fragments, while the nucleusremains ""cold"" until the moment of fission. To verify this hypothesis,experimental distributions for the induced fission of $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm^{238}U$ nuclei, as well as the spontaneous fission of $\rm ^{252}Cf$, werecompared. The results show reasonable agreement both in the magnitude of themean spin values and in the sawtooth shape of the sip distribution with respectto the fragment mass number.

Development of decay energy spectroscopy for radio impurity analysis,"Abstract: We present the development of a decay energy spectroscopy (DES) method forthe analysis of radioactive impurities using magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs).The DES system was designed to analyze radionuclides, such as Ra-226, Th-228,and their daughter nuclides, in materials like copper, commonly used inrare-event search experiments. We tested the DES system with a gold foilabsorber measuring 20x20x0.05 mm^3, large enough to accommodate a significantdrop of source solution. Using this large absorber and an MMC sensor, weconducted a long-term measurement over ten days of live time, requiring 11 ADRcooling cycles. The combined spectrum achieved an energy resolution of 45 keVFWHM, sufficient to identify most alpha and DES peaks of interest. Specificdecay events from radionuclide contaminants in the absorber were identified.This experiment confirms the capability of the DES system to measure alphadecay chains of Ra-226 and Th-228, offering a promising method forradio-impurity evaluation in ultra-low background experiments.",12/5/2024,"['spectroscopy', 'radionuclides', '20x20x0', 'radionuclide', 'microcalorimeters']"
Sensitivity of Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering observables to  GPDs,"Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are multidimensonal structurefunctions that encode the information about the internal structure of hadrons.Using privileged channels such as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) orTimelike Compton Scattering (TCS), it is possible to make direct measurementsat points where the momentum fraction of the parton equals the respectivescaling variable. Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) is a not yetmeasured and promising channel for GPD studies as it allows to perform moregeneral measurements at independent momentum fraction and scaling variablevalues. GPDs are extracted from Compton Form Factors which arise naturally inexperimental observables from different combinations of beam and targetconfigurations. In the context of the Continuous Electron Beam AcceleratorFacility (CEBAF) and the Electron Ion Collider (EIC), we report the results ofan exhaustive study of the DDVCS observables from polarized electron andpositron beams directed to a polarized proton target. The study focuses on thesensitivity of the observables to the parton helicity conserving proton GPDs,particularly the consequences for GPDs measurements via DDVCS at CEBAF and EICbased on the VGG and GK19 model predictions.",12/4/2024,"['acceleratorfacility', 'electron', 'targetconfigurations', 'collider', 'multidimensonal']"
Evolution of Shell Structure at $N=32$ and 34: Insights from Realistic  Nuclear Forces and the Role of Tensor Component,"Abstract: The evolution of nuclear shell structures at $N=32$ and 34 are studied innuclei far from the stability line using effective interactions derived fromrealistic nuclear forces. The state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} in-mediumsimilarity renormalization group method is used for this purpose. Thecalculated results are consistent with experimental observations, andpredictions are made where experimental data are unavailable. The shell gapsare analyzed from the evolution of effective single-particle energies, andvarious facets of nuclear interaction, such as central, spin-orbit, and tensorparts, are addressed by spin-tensor decomposition of the effectiveinteractions. The roles played by these components in the development of shellclosure, particularly by the tensor components, were highlighted throughout thestudy. Then, we discussed the low-lying structure of the exotic $N=32$ isotonesbelow Ca.

Advancing Tritium Self-Sufficiency in Fusion Power Plants: Insights from  the BABY Experiment,"Abstract: In the pursuit of fusion power, achieving tritium self-sufficiency stands asa pivotal challenge. Tritium breeding within molten salts is a critical aspectof next-generation fusion reactors, yet experimental measurements of \gls{tbr}have remained elusive. Here we present the results of the \gls{baby}experiment, which represents a pioneering effort in tritium research byutilizing high-energy (\SI{14}{\mega\electronvolt}) neutron irradiation ofmolten salts, a departure from conventional low-energy neutron approaches.Using a small-scale (\SI{100}{\milli\litre}) molten salt tritium breedingsetup, we not only simulated, but also directly measured a \gls{tbr}. Thisinnovative approach provides crucial experimental validation, offering insightsunattainable through simulation alone. Moreover, our findings reveal asurprising outcome: tritium was predominantly collected as HT, contrary to theexpected TF. This underscores the complexity of tritium behavior in moltensalts, highlighting the need for further investigation. This work lays thefoundation for a more sophisticated experimental setup, including increasingthe volume of the breeder, enhancing neutron detection, and refining tritiumcollection systems.

Constraint on initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding fluids  from nonlinear causality,"Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids inrelativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinearcausality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it isbelieved that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions startsto behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by nomeans trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei thefluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expandingviscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinearcausality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify theinverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid.The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causalityconditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energiesper rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial propertime and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. Thisanalysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ioncollisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other thanthe framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.",12/3/2024,"['nonlinearcausality', 'equations', 'expandingviscous', 'ioncollisions', 'collisions']"

Fitting the experimental data using achemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients thatwere not directly measured in the ion trap.

Neutron Counting Statistics calculations Using Deterministic Transport,"Abstract: For a number of applications like low-source reactor start-up or neutroncoincidence counting it is necessary to take into account the stochastic natureof neutron transport and go beyond the average neutron density, which issolution of a linear Boltzmann equation. In this work, we are particularlyinterested in calculating the moments and probabilities of the number ofneutrons detected during a time window. It is known that in case of a singleinitial neutron these quantities are solution of a system of coupled adjointtransport equations and that a neutron source can be taken into account in asecond time using summations with the source strength. The purpose of thepresent work is first to present the derivation of these equations in a formwhere they can be solved up an arbitrary order and where the fission terms areexpanded according to the moments of the fission multiplicity. For simplicity,the derivation is first presented in a lumped also called point modelapproximation before considering the full phase-space case.

Enhanced production of 60Fe in massive stars,"Abstract: Massive stars are a major source of chemical elements in the cosmos, ejectingfreshly produced nuclei through winds and core-collapse supernova explosionsinto the interstellar medium. Among the material ejected, long livedradioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs ofactive nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancybetween the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by {\gamma}-ray telescopes and predictionsfrom supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties inthe nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular,the neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that providea strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that theproduction of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, furtherincreasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. Thepersisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclearuncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models.",12/2/2024,"['supernova', 'interstellar', 'nuclearuncertainties', 'cosmos', 'explosionsinto']"

Radiative neutron capture cross section of $^{242}$Pu measured at  n_TOF-EAR1 in the unresolved resonance region up to 600 keV,"Abstract: The design of fast reactors burning MOX fuels requires accurate capture andfission cross sections. For the particular case of neutron capture on 242Pu,the NEA recommends that an accuracy of 8-12% should be achieved in the fastenergy region (2 keV-500 keV) compared to their estimation of 35% for thecurrent uncertainty. Integral irradiation experiments suggest that theevaluated cross section of the JEFF-3.1 library overestimates the242Pu(n,{\gamma}) cross section by 14% in the range between 1 keV and 1 MeV. Inaddition, the last measurement at LANSCE reported a systematic reduction of20-30% in the 1-40 keV range relative to the evaluated libraries and previousdata sets. In the present work this cross section has been determined up to 600keV in order to solve the mentioned discrepancies. A 242Pu target of 95(4) mgenriched to 99.959% was irradiated at the n TOF-EAR1 facility at CERN. Thecapture cross section of 242Pu has been obtained between 1 and 600 keV with asystematic uncertainty (dominated by background subtraction) between 8 and 12%,reducing the current uncertainties of 35% and achieving the accuracy requestedby the NEA in a large energy range. The shape of the cross section has beenanalyzed in terms of average resonance parameters using the FITACS code asimplemented in SAMMY, yielding results compatible with our recent analysis ofthe resolved resonance region.The results are in good agreement with the dataof Wisshak and K\""appeler and on average 10-14% below JEFF-3.2 from 1 to 250keV, which helps to achieve consistency between integral experiments and crosssection data. At higher energies our results show a reasonable agreement withinuncertainties with both ENDF/B-VII.1 and JEFF-3.2. Our results indicate thatthe last experiment from DANCE underestimates the capture cross section of242Pu by as much as 40% above a few keV.",12/2/2024,"['fastenergy', 'reactors', 'neutron', '250kev', 'the242pu']"

Measurement of $p$-$Ξ^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\barΞ^{+}$) Correlation  Function in Isobar and Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV  with the STAR Detector,"Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions between baryons, especiallyhyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interactions, is crucial for comprehending theequation-of-state (EoS) of the nuclear matter and inner structure of neutronstar. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) correlation functions with high statistics inIsobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200GeV by the STAR experiment.

Recent results from STAR for parton distribution functions at low and  high $x$ in proton-proton collisions,"Abstract: According to perturbative quantum chromodynamic calculations, in $pp$collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $~200 and 510 GeV studied at RHIC, jet production inmid-pseudorapidity, $|\eta| <$ 1, is dominated by quark-gluon and gluon-gluonscattering processes. Therefore jets at RHIC are direct probes of the gluonparton distribution functions (PDFs) for momentum fractions 0.01 $<x<$ 0.5.Moreover, $W$ boson cross section ratio, $\sigma(W^+)/\sigma(W^-)$, in $pp$collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV, is an effective tool to explore anti-quarkPDFs, $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$. Last but not least, di-$\pi^{0}$ correlation inforward pseudorapidity, $2.6 < \eta <4.0$, is an important indication of thenon-linear gluon dynamics at low $x$ where the gluon density is high in protonsand nuclei. In this proceeding, we present recent STAR results ofmid-pseudorapidity inclusive jet cross-sections at $\sqrt{s} =$~200 and 510 GeVin $pp$ collisions, $W$ boson cross-section ratios at $\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV in$pp$ collisions, and forward di-$\pi^0$ correlations in $pp$, $p\textrm{Al}$and $p\textrm{Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{\tiny NN}}} = 200$~GeV.",11/30/2024,"['chromodynamic', 'quantum', 'protonsand', 'jets', 'pdfs']"
Radial Oscillations in Hybrid Stars with Slow Quark Phase Transition,"Abstract: This study investigates the radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars,characterized by a composition of hadronic external layers and a quark mattercore. Utilizing a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model thatincorporates hyperons and baryons for describing hadronic matter, and adensity-dependent quark model for quark matter, we analyze the ten lowesteigenfrequencies and their corresponding oscillation functions. Our focus lieson neutron stars with equations-of-state involving N, N + $\Delta$, N + H, andN + H + $\Delta$, featuring a phase transition to quark matter. Emphasizing theeffects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observethat the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode's frequencydecreases for slow phase transitions. This observation implies the stability ofstellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass,called Slow Stable Hybrid Stars (SSHSs), even under small radial perturbations.The length of these SSHS branch depends upon the energy density jump betweentwo phases and the stiffness of the quark EoS.",12/5/2024,"['neutron', 'hyperons', 'quark', 'frequencydecreases', 'stars']"
Robustness of the proxy-SU(3) symmetry in atomic nuclei and the role of  the next highest weight irreducible representation,"Abstract: The proxy-SU(3) symmetry predicts, in a parameter-free way, the collectivedeformation variables beta and gamma in even-even atomic nuclei away fromclosed shells based on the highest weight irreducible representations (irreps)of SU(3) in the relevant proton and neutron shells, which are the mostsymmetric irreps allowed by the Pauli principle and the short-range nature ofthe nucleon-nucleon interactions.

Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star  oscillations: a model comparison,"Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certainnuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to bestrongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such asthe frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrainthe values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of ourprimary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations arephysical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, weperform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysicalobservables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation ofstate models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM)scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model andtherefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. Thecalculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within therelativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopiccalculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data athigh-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter spaceof the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlyingcorrelations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that thecorrelation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while thatof the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The studyshows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models,while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, andhence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. Thefindings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well asnuclear physics communities.",12/5/2024,"['astrophysicalobservables', 'physics', 'astrophysics', 'astrophysical', 'nuclear']"
Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid  stars within four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"Abstract: We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter onthe structural properties of neutron stars within the four-dimensionalEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB). We employ the density-dependentrelativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and thedensity-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to constructhadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that are consistent with theastrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with aphase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared dropsto around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration which lies in the pure quarkphase. Adjusting the Gaussian-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ within itsallowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship fornegative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition,functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as afunction of constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties.",12/4/2024,"['neutron', 'quarkphase', 'hyperons', 'quark', 'dimensionaleinstein']"
Impact of nuclear masses on r-process nucleosynthesis: bulk properties  versus shell effects,"Abstract: Decomposing theoretical nuclear mass predictions into a liquid-dropparametrization and local shell effects shows that r-process abundances arevirtually insensitive to large variations of the masses which originate fromnuclear bulk properties of the model, such as the symmetry energy. Therefore,experimental and theoretical studies of masses devoted to r-processapplications, such as the nucleosynthesis in the ejecta of neutron starmergers, should focus on the physical origin of local changes in mass trendswithout necessarily providing highly accurate mass determinations of individualnuclei.",12/4/2024,"['nucleosynthesis', 'nuclear', 'neutron', 'theoretical', 'starmergers']"
Generalized susceptibilities of net-baryon number based on the  3-dimensional Ising universality class,"Abstract: Assuming the equilibrium of the QCD system, we have investigated the criticalbehavior of sixth-, eighth- and tenth-order susceptibilities of net-baryonnumber, through mapping the results in the three-dimensional Ising model tothat of QCD. Both the leading critical contribution as well as sub-leadingcritical contribution from the Ising model are discussed. When considering onlythe leading critical contribution, the density plots for susceptibilities ofthe same order demonstrate a consistent general pattern independent on valuesof mapping parameters. As the critical point is approached from the crossoverside, a negative dip followed by a positive peak is observed in the $\mu_B$dependence of the three different orders of susceptibilities. When sub-leadingcritical contribution is taken into account, modifications become apparent inthe density plots of the susceptibilities. The emergence of negative dips inthe $\mu_B$ dependence of the susceptibilities is not an absolute phenomenon,while the positive peak structure is a more robust feature of the criticalpoint.",12/4/2024,"['criticalbehavior', 'qcd', 'leadingcritical', 'susceptibilities', 'baryonnumber']"
Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption,"Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields,with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that arepossibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In thepresence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protonsare quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly,even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$,we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are notcaptured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energylevels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplificationof the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation thatneglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are notimportant for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may berelevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. Wepresent a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strongmagnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean fieldnuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modifiedwavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools arealso applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields inthe ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities forneutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities andtemperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes ofthe lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppressionof electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from theeffect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.",12/4/2024,"['neutrinos', 'neutrino', 'protons', 'strongmagnetic', 'neutrons']"

To assess itspredictive capability, we test the trained model on an additional set of 10 newnuclei, where experimental data exist. Our results demonstrate that theartificial neural network not only accurately reproduces known data but alsoidentifies potential inconsistencies in certain experimental datasets,indicating which results may warrant further review or possible rejection.Additionally, for nuclei where experimental data are sparse or unavailable, thenetwork confirms theoretical calculations, reinforcing its utility as apredictive tool in nuclear physics.

Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory  and holography,"Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effectiveframework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamicalelectromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications acrossdiverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe,and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effectivetheories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide asystematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. Inthis work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry,where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixedboundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly isintroduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SKanalysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from thismodel aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and,in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field.This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the wayfor its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recentlyproposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiralinstabilities.",12/3/2024,"['magnetohydrodynamics', 'dynamicalelectromagnetic', 'chiralinstabilities', 'dirac', 'semimetals']"

ACE2-SOM: Coupling to a slab ocean and learning the sensitivity of  climate to changes in CO$_2$,"Abstract: While autoregressive machine-learning-based emulators have been trained toproduce stable and accurate rollouts in the climate of the present-day andrecent past, none so far have been trained to emulate the sensitivity ofclimate to substantial changes in CO$_2$ or other greenhouse gases. As aninitial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model(hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection ofequilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels ofCO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios withCO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training.ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sampleand out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergenttime-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change withCO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile ofatmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates with increasedCO$_2$ closely agree with the reference model. Non-equilibrium-climateinference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing gradually at a rate of 2%year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the global annual mean trends ofsurface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but produces unphysical jumps instratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling of CO$_2$, ML-controlledfields transition unrealistically quickly to the 4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing sothey violate global energy conservation and exhibit unphysical sensitivities ofand surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes to instantaneous changes inCO$_2$. Future emulator development needed to address these issues shouldimprove its generalizability to diverse climate change scenarios.",12/5/2024,"['climateinference', 'physics', 'ofequilibrium', 'greenhouse', 'trained']"
Reduction of thermal instability of soliton states in coupled  Kerr-microresonators,"Abstract: Kerr-microresonator frequency combs in integrated photonics waveguides arepromising technologies for next-generation positioning, navigation, and timingapplications, with advantages that include platforms that are mass-producibleand CMOS-compatible and spectra that are phase-coherent and octave-spanning.Fundamental thermal noise in the resonator material typically limits the timingand frequency stability of a microcomb. The small optical mode volume of themicroresonators exaggerates this effect, as it both increases the magnitude andshortens the timescale of thermodynamic fluctuations. In this work, weinvestigate thermal instability in silicon nitride microring resonators as wellas techniques for reducing their effects on the microcomb light. Wecharacterize the time-dependent thermal response in silicon nitride microringresonators through experimental measurements and finite element methodsimulations.

Enhanced Sampling of Protein Conformational Changes via True Reaction  Coordinates from Energy Relaxation,"Abstract: The bottleneck in enhanced sampling lies in finding collective variables(CVs) that can effectively accelerate protein conformational changes. Truereaction coordinates (tRCs) that can predict the committor are considered theoptimal CVs, but identifying them requires unbiased natural reactivetrajectories, which, paradoxically, depend on effective enhanced sampling.Using the generalized work functional method, we found that tRCs control bothconformational changes and energy relaxation, enabling us to compute tRCs fromenergy relaxation simulations. Applying bias to tRCs accelerated conformationalchanges and ligand dissociation in HIV-1 protease and the PDZ2 domain by 10^5to 10^15-fold. The resulting trajectories follow natural transition pathways,enabling efficient generation of natural reactive trajectories. In contrast,biased trajectories from empirical CVs often display non-physical features.Furthermore, by computing tRCs from a single protein structure, our methodenables predictive sampling of conformational changes. These findingssignificantly broaden the range of protein functional processes accessible tomolecular dynamics simulations.",12/5/2024,"['protein', 'fromenergy', 'findingssignificantly', 'reactivetrajectories', 'simulations']"

Interatomic Coulombic decay in lithium-doped large helium nanodroplets  induced by photoelectron impact excitation,"Abstract: Irradiation of condensed matter with ionizing radiation generally causesdirect photoionization as well as secondary processes that often dominate theionization dynamics. Here, large helium (He) nanodroplets with radius >40 nmdoped with lithium (Li) atoms are irradiated with extreme ultraviolet (XUV)photons of energy >44.4 eV and indirect ionization of the Li dopants isobserved in addition to direct photoionization of the He droplets.Specifically, Li ions are efficiently produced by an interatomic Coulombicdecay (ICD) process involving metastable He atoms and He_2 excimers which arepopulated by elastic and inelastic scattering of photoelectrons in thenanodroplets as well as by electron-ion recombination. This type of indirectICD, observed in large He nanodroplets in nearly the entire XUV range, turnsout to be more efficient than Li dopant ionization by ICD following directresonant photoexcitation at a photon energy of 21.6 eV and by charge-transferionization. Indirect ICD processes induced by scattering of photoelectronslikely play an important role in other condensed phase systems exposed toionizing radiation as well, including biological matter.",12/5/2024,"['photoelectronslikely', 'photoelectrons', 'photoexcitation', 'photoionization', 'nanodroplets']"
Small-scale dynamics and structure of free-surface turbulence,"Abstract: The dynamics of small-scale structures in free-surface turbulence is crucialto large-scale phenomena in natural and industrial environments. Here weconduct experiments on the quasi-flat free surface of a zero-mean-flowturbulent water tank over the Reynolds number range $Re_{\lambda} =207\textrm{--}312$. By seeding microscopic floating particles at highconcentrations, the fine scales of the flow and the velocity gradient tensorare resolved. A kinematic relation is derived expressing the contribution ofsurface divergence and vorticity to the dissipation rate. The probabilitydensity functions of divergence, vorticity and strain-rate collapse oncenormalized by the Kolmogorov scales. Their magnitude displays strongintermittency and follows chi-square distributions with power-law tails atsmall values. The topology of high-intensity events and two-point statisticsindicate that the surface divergence is characterized by dissipative spatialand temporal scales, while the high-vorticity and high-strain-rate regions arelarger, long-lived, concurrent, and elongated. The second-order velocitystructure functions obey the classic Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial rangewhen the dissipation rate on the surface is considered, with a differentnumerical constant than in 3D turbulence. The cross-correlation amongdivergence, vorticity and strain-rate indicates that the surface-attachedvortices are strengthened during downwellings and diffuse when those dissipate.Sources (sinks) in the surface velocity fields are associated with strong(weak) surface-parallel stretching and compression along perpendiculardirections. The floating particles cluster over spatial and temporal scaleslarger than those of the sinks. These results demonstrate that, compared to 3Dturbulence, in free-surface turbulence the energetic scales leave a strongerimprint on the small-scale quantities.",12/5/2024,"['3dturbulence', 'turbulence', 'velocitystructure', 'flowturbulent', 'kinematic']"
Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation,"Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, nodeembedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto outputvectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling variousvector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, linkprediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitationsaffect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operationdefining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of theoriginal nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input networkcan be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining theconstituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between nodeembeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here,building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address thesetwo limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that,upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of theembedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of itsconstituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economicnetworks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels:namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and theinput-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirmthe statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained nodevectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a resultthat cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties,including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already fromembeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithfulreplicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.",12/5/2024,"['algorithms', 'graph', 'nodeembeddings', 'nodeembedding', 'economicnetworks']"

Here, we make use of afrequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platformto experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldanemodel where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. Thebands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states' geometry acrossthe Brillouin zone.

Likelihood-Scheduled Score-Based Generative Modeling for Fully 3D PET  Image Reconstruction,"Abstract: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models(SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learnedreconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scannersetups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction hasrecently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets,showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative tothe state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstructionfrom PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuningand slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practicalmethodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction andreduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of anSGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihoodexpectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-countreconstruction from simulated $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show ourmethodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existingstate-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstructiontime and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodologyagainst state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms.Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstructionfor real 3D PET data, specifically $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrateperpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.",12/5/2024,"['scannersetups', 'medical', 'learnedreconstruction', 'practicalmethodology', 'reconstructionfrom']"

As first implementation of MCMC, sampling of the plainBernoulli model is shown. Next, an exponential bias is used for the same model,which allows one to obtain the tails of the distribution of a measurablequantity. This approach is generalized to MCMC simulations, where the statesare vectors of $U(0,1)$ random entries. This allows one to use the exponentialor any other bias to access the large-deviation properties of rather arbitraryrandom processes.

Multi-Subject Image Synthesis as a Generative Prior for Single-Subject  PET Image Reconstruction,"Abstract: Large high-quality medical image datasets are difficult to acquire butnecessary for many deep learning applications. For positron emission tomography(PET), reconstructed image quality is limited by inherent Poisson noise. Wepropose a novel method for synthesising diverse and realistic pseudo-PET imageswith improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also show how our pseudo-PET images maybe exploited as a generative prior for single-subject PET image reconstruction.Firstly, we perform deep-learned deformable registration of multi-subjectmagnetic resonance (MR) images paired to multi-subject PET images. We then usethe anatomically-learned deformation fields to transform multiple PET images tothe same reference space, before averaging random subsets of the transformedmulti-subject data to form a large number of varying pseudo-PET images. Weobserve that using MR information for registration imbues the resultingpseudo-PET images with improved anatomical detail compared to the originals. Weconsider applications to PET image reconstruction, by generating pseudo-PETimages in the same space as the intended single-subject reconstruction andusing them as training data for a diffusion model-based reconstruction method.We show visual improvement and reduced background noise in our 2Dreconstructions as compared to OSEM, MAP-EM and an existing state-of-the-artdiffusion model-based approach. Our method shows the potential for utilisinghighly subject-specific prior information within a generative reconstructionframework.

Generative-Model-Based Fully 3D PET Image Reconstruction by Conditional  Diffusion Sampling,"Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promising resultsfor image reconstruction on simulated positron emission tomography (PET)datasets. In this work we have developed and implemented practical methodologyfor 3D image reconstruction with SGMs, and perform (to our knowledge) the firstSGM-based reconstruction of real fully 3D PET data. We train an SGM onfull-count reference brain images, and extend methodology to allow SGM-basedreconstructions at very low counts (1% of original, to simulate low-dose orshort-duration scanning). We then perform reconstructions for multipleindependent realisations of 1% count data, allowing us to analyse the bias andvariance characteristics of the method. We sample from the learned posteriordistribution of the generative algorithm to calculate uncertainty images forour reconstructions. We evaluate the method's performance on real full- andlow-count PET data and compare with conventional OSEM and MAP-EM baselines,showing that our SGM-based low-count reconstructions match full-dosereconstructions more closely and in a bias-variance trade-off comparison, ourSGM-reconstructed images have lower variance than existing baselines.

Ultralow Voltage Operation of p- and n-FETs Enabled by Self-Formed Gate  Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium,"Abstract: The ongoing demand for more energy-efficient, high-performance electronics isdriving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, whereinterfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of devicedimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its two-dimensional (2D) form, offerssignificant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolarcharacteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation.In this study, we leverage atomically controlled material transformations in 2DTe to create intimate junctions, enabling near-ideal field-effect transistors(FETs) for both n-type and p-type operation. A NiTex-Te contact provides highlytransparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx-Tegate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Teis observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with arecord-low SS of 3.5 mV/dec achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate 2DTe-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters operating atan ultralow voltage of 0.08 V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This workpresents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor andmetal/semiconductor junctions for next-generation low-power electronic devices.",12/5/2024,"['highlytransparent', 'innovative', 'transistors', 'ambipolarcharacteristics', 'efficient']"
Effect of top metallic contacts on energy conversion performances for  near-field thermophotovoltaics,"Abstract: The design of metallic contact grids on the front side of thermophotovoltaiccells is critical since it can cause significant optical and electricalresistive losses, particularly in the near field. However, from the theoreticalpoint of view, this effect has been either discarded or studied by means ofextremely simplified models like the shadowing methods, that consist in simplyignoring the fraction of the semiconductor surface covered by metal. Our study,based on a rigorous three-body theoretical framework and implemented using thescattering matrix approach with the Fourier modal method augmented withadaptive spatial resolution, provides deeper insight into the influence of thefront metal contact grid. This approach allows direct access to the radiativepower absorbed by the semiconductor, enabling the proposal of an alternativedefinition for the thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency. By modeling this grid asa metallic grating, we demonstrate its significant impact on the net radiativepower absorbed by the cell and, consequently, on the generated electricalpower. Our analysis reveals behaviors differing substantially from thosepredicted by previous simplistic approaches.",12/5/2024,"['thermophotovoltaiccells', 'thermophotovoltaic', 'semiconductor', 'electricalresistive', 'electricalpower']"
On Deep-Learning-Based Closures for Algebraic Surrogate Models of  Turbulent Flows,"Abstract: A deep-learning-based closure model to address energy loss in low-dimensionalsurrogate models based on proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) modes isintroduced. Using a transformer-encoder block with easy-attention mechanism,the model predicts the spatial probability density function of fluctuations notcaptured by the truncated POD modes. The methodology is demonstrated on thewake of the Windsor body at yaw angles of [2.5,5,7.5,10,12.5], with 7.5 as atest case. Key coherent modes are identified by clustering them based ondominant frequency dynamics using Hotelling T2 on the spectral properties oftemporal coefficients. These coherent modes account for nearly 60% of the totalenergy while comprising less than 10% of all modes. A common POD basis iscreated by concatenating coherent modes from training angles andorthonormalizing the set, reducing the basis vectors from 142 to 90 withoutlosing information. Transformers with different size on the attention layer,(64, 128 and 256), are trained to model the missing fluctuations. Largerattention sizes always improve predictions for the training set, but thetransformer with an attention layer of size 256 overshoots the fluctuationspredictions in the test set because they have lower intensity than in thetraining cases. Adding the predicted fluctuations closes the energy gap betweenthe reconstruction and the original flow field, improving predictions forenergy, root-mean-square velocity fluctuations, and instantaneous flow fields.The deepest architecture reduces mean energy error from 37% to 12% anddecreases the Kullback--Leibler divergence of velocity distributions fromKL=0.2 to below KL=0.026.",12/5/2024,"['fluctuationspredictions', 'andorthonormalizing', 'dimensionalsurrogate', 'transformer', 'reconstruction']"

Numerical Estimation of Limiting Large-Deviation Rate Functions,"Abstract: For statistics of rare events in systems obeying a large-deviation principle,the rate function is a key quantity. When numerically estimating the ratefunction one is always restricted to finite system sizes. Thus, if the interestis in the limiting rate function for infinite system sizes, first, severalsystem sizes have to be studied numerically. Here, rare-event algorithms usingbiased ensembles give access to the low-probability region. Second, some kindof system-size extrapolation has to be performed.Here we demonstrate how rare-event importance sampling schemes can becombined with multi-histogram reweighting, which allows for rather generalapplicability of the approach, independent of specific sampling algorithms. Westudy two ways of performing the system-size extrapolation, either directlyacting on the empirical rate functions, or on the scaled cumulant generatingfunctions, to obtain the infinite-size limit. The presented method isdemonstrated for a binomial distributed variable and the largest connectedcomponent in Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs. Analytical solutions are availablein both cases for direct comparison. It is observed in particular that phasetransitions appearing in the biased ensembles can lead to systematic deviationsfrom the true result.",12/5/2024,"['algorithms', 'connectedcomponent', 'generatingfunctions', 'ratefunction', 'numerically']"
Monolithic integration of blue light sources into silicon nitride  photonic chips,"Abstract: We investigate theoretically photonic chips with monolithically integratedblue light sources.

Symmetry-Based Classification of Chern Phases in Honeycomb Photonic  Crystals,"Abstract: In this work, we develop a symmetry-based classification of Chern phases inhoneycomb photonic crystals, considering arbitrary nonreciprocal couplingscompatible with energy conservation. Our analysis focuses on crystals formedthrough nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene. These perturbations,which can have arbitrary spatial variations, are generally described by scalarand vector fields. Using a tight-binding model, we consider the most generalnonreciprocal interactions, including gyromagnetic, pseudo-Tellegen, and movingmedium responses, and examine how the corresponding nonreciprocal fieldsinfluence the crystal's topology. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocalinteractions alone are insufficient to induce a topologically nontrivial phase.Instead, a nontrivial p6m component in the nonreciprocal fields is required toopen a bandgap and achieve a non-zero Chern number. These results provide asymmetry-based roadmap for engineering photonic topological phases vianonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene, offering practical guidelinesfor designing topological phases in graphene-like photonic crystals.",12/5/2024,"['graphene', 'crystals', 'topology', 'movingmedium', 'inhoneycomb']"
Core-periphery detection in multilayer networks,"Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systemsthat capture different types of interactions between the same set of entitiesacross multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning thenodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across thenetwork, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core butsparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model ofcore-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method thatsimultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of bothnodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks.

Differential Magnetic Force Microscopy with a Switchable Tip,"Abstract: The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic forcemicroscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostaticforces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized tomap the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces fromvan der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tipmagnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, wepresent an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on aflat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to aminiaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip magnetization. Thissetup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from thesidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillationspectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from otherforce contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup mayincorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high qualityfactors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders ofmagnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.",12/5/2024,"['forcemicroscope', 'electromagnet', 'electrostaticforces', 'microscope', 'magnetic']"
Parametric Gaussian quadratures for Discrete Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme,"Abstract: The discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) has emerged as a promisingBoltzmann solver capable of effectively capturing flow physics across allKnudsen numbers. However, simulating rarefied flows at high Knudsen numbersremains computationally demanding. This paper introduces a parametric Gaussianquadrature (PGQ) rule designed to improve the computational efficiency ofDUGKS. The PGQ rule employs Gaussian functions for weighting and introducesseveral novel forms of higher-dimensional Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Initially,the velocity space is mapped to polar or spherical coordinates using aparameterized integral transformation method, which converts multiple integralsinto repeated parametric integrals. Subsequently, Gaussian points and weightcoefficients are computed based on the newly defined parametric weightfunctions. The parameters in PGQ allow the distribution of Gaussian points tobe adjusted according to computational requirements, addressing the limitationsof traditional Gaussian quadratures where Gaussian points are difficult tomatch the distribution of real particles in rarefied flows. To validate theproposed approach, numerical examples across various Knudsen numbers areprovided. The simulation results demonstrate that PGQ offers superiorcomputational efficiency and flexibility compared to the traditionalNewton-Cotes rule and the half-range Gaussian Hermite rule, achievingcomputational efficiency that is tens of times higher than that of theNewton-Cotes method. This significantly enhances the computational efficiencyof DUGKS and augments its ability to accurately simulate rarefied flowdynamics.",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'promisingboltzmann', 'flowdynamics', 'achievingcomputational', 'superiorcomputational']"
Terahertz-driven Two-Dimensional Mapping for Electron Temporal Profile  Measurement,"Abstract: The precision measurement of real-time electron temporal profiles is crucialfor advancing electron and X-ray devices used in ultrafast imaging andspectroscopy. While high temporal resolution and large temporal window can beachieved separately using different technologies, real-time measurementenabling simultaneous high resolution and large window remains challenging.Here, we present the first THz-driven sampling electron oscilloscope capable ofmeasuring electron pulses with high temporal resolution and a scalable, largetemporal window simultaneously. The transient THz electric field inducestemporal electron streaking in the vertical axis, while extended interactionalong the horizontal axis leads to a propagation-induced time delay, enablingelectron beam sampling with sub-cycle THz wave. This allows real-timefemtosecond electron measurement with a tens-of-picosecond window, surpassingprevious THz-based techniques by an order of magnitude. The measurementcapability is further enhanced through projection imaging, deflection cavitytilting, and shorted antenna utilization, resulting in signal spatialmagnification, extended temporal window, and increased field strength.

Dielectric Loaded Waveguide Terahertz LINACs,"Abstract: Dielectric loaded waveguides (DLWs) driven by multicycle terahertz (THz)pulses hold great promise as compact linear accelerators (LINACs) due to theirability to sustain higher breakdown fields at THz frequencies compared toconventional RF components. Precise control of the THz pulse's phase and groupvelocities within the DLW can be achieved by adjusting the dimensions of thedielectric tube.

Diamond-defect engineering of NV- centers using ion beam irradiation,"Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range andthe controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centersin nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimentalapproach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assesstheir respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ionenergies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies.Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite thepresence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment isessential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often throughelectron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV-densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving thematerial's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores andquantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancydistributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- centerformation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.",12/4/2024,"['recombination', 'ionenergies', 'spectroscopy', 'photoluminescence', 'crystals']"

Yet, the achievement ofmodulators exploiting Pockels effect in flat optics, essential to scale downthe electric radiation-optical control in free space, currently lag behind bulkand on-chip integrated platforms in terms efficiency and speed. We bridge thisgap realizing a metasurface based on lithium niobate (LiNbO3) on insulator thatleverages on resonances with quality-factor as high as 8e3 to achieve fastelectrical modulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. LiNbO3,well known for its high nonlinear susceptibility and wide transparency windowacross the infrared and visible spectrum, is employed to realize an asymmetric,one-dimensional array of nanowires, exhibiting resonances with linewidth < 0.2nm. By applying a CMOS-compatible electrical bias, the metasurface imparts arelative reflectivity modulation around 0.1, with a modulation efficiency,defined as relative modulation per applied Volt, larger than 0.01 V^-1 on abandwidth of about 1 GHz. We also demonstrated more than one order of magnitudeintensity modulation of the second harmonic seeded by a continuous-wave laser,with a modulation efficiency of about 0.12 V^-1.

"Analysis, Design, and Fabrication of a High-Gain Low-Profile Metasurface  Antenna Using Direct Feeding of Sievenpiper s HIS","Abstract: HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to exciteplasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In thispaper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feedingedge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast toother metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excitemetasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology thatdirectly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developeda circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with thoseobtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was tosimplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna.This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel striplines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification alsocreates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the topsurface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wavesimulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of theproposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators(1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free spacewavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype andconducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrategood agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and aHPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within therequired dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, whilemaintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, andcompact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems,such as car to car communications.",12/3/2024,"['feedingedge', 'spacewavelength', 'antennas', 'antenna', 'simulations']"
Tunable acoustic energy concentrations based on pseudo-spin locking  waveguides and topological rainbow trappings,"Abstract: In this work, tunable acoustic energy concentrations are realized based onpseudo-spin locking waveguides and topological rainbow trappings. Firstly, atunable pseudo-spin locking is proposed, and the broad acoustic energytransport and spin-locked one-way transport are verified. The results show thatacoustic wave transports based on pseudo-spin locking waveguides are morerobust to structure defects than conventional topological edge-statewaveguides. Besides, topological rainbow trappings are realized by adjustingthe distribution of liquid in tubes. Based on those, we investigate thecoupling of the pseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbowtrappings. The results show that high acoustic energy concentrations can beobtained conveniently by using the coupling energy concentrator based on thepseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbow trappings. Theresults present a novel method to concentrate acoustic wave energy, which isvital in the application field of acoustic sensings and microfludics.The according experimental verifications will be presented in the nearfuture.",12/3/2024,"['rainbowtrappings', 'waveguides', 'statewaveguides', 'acoustic', 'energytransport']"
Dry Transfer Based on PMMA and Thermal Release Tape for Heterogeneous  Integration of 2D-TMDC Layers,"Abstract: A reliable and scalable transfer of 2D-TMDCs (two-dimensional transitionmetal dichalcogenides) from the growth substrate to a target substrate withhigh reproducibility and yield is a crucial step for device integration. Inthis work, we have introduced a scalable dry-transfer approach for 2D-TMDCsgrown by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) on sapphire. Transferto a silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO$_2$) substrate is performed using PMMA(poly(methyl methacrylate)) and TRT (thermal release tape) as sacrificial layerand carrier, respectively. Our proposed method ensures a reproducible peel-offfrom the growth substrate and better preservation of the 2D-TMDC during PMMAremoval in solvent, without compromising its adhesion to the target substrate.A comprehensive comparison between the dry method introduced in this work and astandard wet transfer based on potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution showsimprovement in terms of cleanliness and structural integrity fordry-transferred layer, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission and Ramanspectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, fabricated field-effect transistors(FETs) demonstrate improvements in subthreshold slope, maximum drain currentand device-to-device variability. The dry-transfer method developed in thiswork enables large-area integration of 2D-TMDC layers into (opto)electroniccomponents with high reproducibility, while better preserving the as-grownproperties of the layers.",12/3/2024,"['ramanspectroscopy', 'transistors', 'potassium', 'sapphire', 'scalable']"
Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender  Setup,"Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercialVector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequencyrange from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept isbased on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highlyfrequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CWphotomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for thestraightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or evenbeyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional laserswithin the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additionalfrequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, iseliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the systemsignificantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector NetworkAnalyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements ofvarious cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF)components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were eithercompared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against dataobtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.",12/3/2024,"['laserswithin', 'lasers', 'photonic', 'ghz', 'networkanalyzer']"

Here we present thedesign of a 6-port junction that exhibits equal power splitting to three otherports when excited at single port with no reflections. In studying thisstructure, a scattering matrix is extracted at telecom wavelengths (around 1550nm). The linearity of the system along with the scattering matrix are exploitedto produce linear operations such as routing of information considering twoincident signals or multiple signals applied from different ports.

Effect of nonreciprocal thermal radiation on radiative cooling,"Abstract: Radiative cooling has showcased great potential for passive refrigerationwithout extra energy consumption, while its cooling power and efficiency isconfined by Kirchhoff's law, that is, the emissivity is equal to theabsorptivity. The recent development of thermal nonreciprocity that breaks thelimitations of Kirchhoff's law, especially in broadband manner, makesnonreciprocal radiative cooling (NRC) possible. Since there lacks of reports ofNRC theoretically or experimentally, it is time to evaluate the feasibility andworthiness of develop NRC. Here, we discussed the effects of NRC at around roomtemperature (298.15 K) from three perspectives: ideal selective radiators,non-selective radiators, and colored radiators. Compared to the traditionalreciprocal radiative cooling, the nonreciprocity within the non-atmosphericwindow band (4-8 {\mu}m or 13-25 {\mu}m) exhibits a certain gain, yet thenonreciprocity in the atmospheric window band (8-13 {\mu}m) results in anegative gain. Additionally, it should be noted that the radiators discussed inthis work are horizontally placed without the influence of asymmetric externalheat sources. The current findings shatter the inherent notion of nonreciprocalradiative cooling and offer some theoretical support for the practicalrealization and application of nonreciprocal radiative refrigeration devices.",12/3/2024,"['broadband', 'practicalrealization', 'refrigerationwithout', 'efficiency', 'cooling']"
Stimulated Raman Scattering in Nonlinear Silicon Nanophotonic  Waveguides: Theory and Applications in Photonic Integrated Circuits,"Abstract: Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallicinterconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digitalprocessors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation wasmore attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, bothactive and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials.Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history,and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However,due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possibleusing silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulatedRaman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoidthis natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source.

A Light-Emitting-Diodes-Integrated Silicon Carbide Insulated Gate  Bipolar Transistor,"Abstract: A light-emitting-diodes (LEDs)-integrated silicon carbide (SiC) insulatedgate bipolar transistors (LI-IGBT) is proposed in this paper. The novelty ofthe LI-IGBT depends on the photogeneration effect of III-nitride LEDs embeddedin the poly-Si regions of IGBT. Then, the photogenerated carriers are formed inthe JFET region and the drift layer, indicating the increase of theconductivity in LI-IGBT as compared with the SiC IGBT with hole-barrier layer(H-IGBT) and the SiC IGBT with charge storage layer (CSL-IGBT). The staticsimulation results show that the electron density of the LI-IGBT at the middleof the drift layer is separately 17.44 times and 15.81 times higher than thoseof the H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT, yielding 40.91% and 37.38% reduction of forwardvoltage drop, respectively, and also, the LI-IGBT shows 304.59% and 263.67%improvements in BFOM as compared with CSL-IGBT and H-IGBT, respectively. Forthe dynamic simulation in one cycle, the loss of LI-IGBT is separately reducedby 6.57% and 8.57% compared to H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT. Meanwhile, the relationshipbetween VC(sat) and Eturn-off can be optimized by adjusting collector dopingand minority carrier lifetime. These results reveal that the proposed SiC IGBTwill be more suitable for ultra-high voltage application.",12/2/2024,"['transistors', 'silicon', 'photogeneration', 'photogenerated', 'electron']"
Optimisation and Loss Analyses of Pulsed Field Magnetisation in a  Superconducting Motor with Cryocooled Iron Cores,"Abstract: A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled numerical model has been developed usingthe finite element method and validated against experimental data toinvestigate a superconducting machine featuring high-temperaturesuperconducting (HTS) tape stacks and cryocooled iron cores. The HTS stacks aretransformed into trapped field stacks (TFSs) through pulsed field magnetisation(PFM), generating rotor fields. After PFM, the superconducting motor operateson the same principle as permanent magnet synchronous motors. This studyexplores the behaviour of HTS stacks by altering the stack's layer number fromone to nine and adjusting the pulsed current amplitude from 250 A to 1000 A.The primary objective of this paper is to identify the optimal combination ofpulsed current amplitudes and TFS layer numbers for achieving maximummagnetisation fields. The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall lossesin both superconducting and non-superconducting parts of the machine duringmagnetisation, including heat generated in various layers of the TFS, andlosses in the motor's active materials (copper windings and iron cores). Twomotor configurations were proposed, and two calculation methods using linearinterpolation of iron losses and steel grades were introduced to estimate theiron losses for the studied iron material, M270-35A. This pioneering study isexpected to serve as a valuable reference for loss analyses and structuraldesign considerations in developing superconducting machines.",12/2/2024,"['superconducting', 'temperaturesuperconducting', 'maximummagnetisation', 'linearinterpolation', 'magnetisation']"
Optical excitation of bulk plasmons in n-doped InAsSb thin films :  investigating the second viscosity in electron gas,"Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in thehydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical responseof heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonancevisibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become moredistinct, allowing for detailed analysis of the underlying physics. Withadvanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and atailored optimization algorithm, we obtain close agreement between simulationsand experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhancedresonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that keyparameters such as doping level and effective electron mass can be retrievedfrom a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account inthe hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the opticalresponse of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to becomea standard modeling approach.",12/2/2024,"['physics', 'enhancedresonance', 'semiconductors', 'keyparameters', 'opticalresponse']"
"Higly efficient, tunable, electro-optic metasurfaces based on  quasi-bound states in the continuum","Abstract: Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling trulyspatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionizemodern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive.In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces basedon quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that areamenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control overreflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithiumniobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector anda grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes.Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed byutilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrowqBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle oflight incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecomwavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % ofthe total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electricalbandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonancerealized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using thefabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHzestimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\mu$m, the demonstratedelectro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique opticalfunctions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well asnonreciprocal operation.",12/2/2024,"['ultrafast', 'opticalfunctions', 'electricalbandwidth', 'resonancerealized', 'photonics']"

We emulate key ocean variables, sea surfaceheight, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their fulldepth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepthlevels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - whichexhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure ofocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable forcenturies and 150 times faster than the original ocean model.

Large role of anthropogenic climate change in driving smoke exposure  across the western United States from 1992 to 2020,"Abstract: Wildfire activity has increased dramatically in the western United States(US) over the last three decades, having a significant impact on air qualityand human health. However, quantifying the drivers of trends in wildfires andsubsequent smoke exposure is challenging, as both natural variability andanthropogenic climate change play important roles. Here we devise an approachinvolving observed meteorology and vegetation and a range of models todetermine the relative roles of anthropogenic climate change and naturalvariability in driving burned area across the western US. We also examine theinfluence of anthropogenic climate change on smoke exposure. We estimate thatanthropogenic climate change accounts for 33-82% of observed total burned area,depending on the ecoregion, yielding 65% of total fire emissions on averageacross the western US from 1992 to 2020. In all ecoregions except MediterraneanCalifornia, anthropogenic climate change contributes to a greater percentage ofburned area in lightning-caused wildfires than in human-caused wildfires. Onaverage, anthropogenic climate change contributes 49% to smoke PM2.5concentrations in the western US from 1997 to 2020, and explains 58% of theincreasing trend in smoke PM2.5 from 2010 to 2020. We further find thatpopulations in northern California, western Oregon, Washington, and parts ofIdaho have experienced the greatest smoke exposure attributable toanthropogenic climate change in recent years. Our work highlights thesignificant role of anthropogenic climate change in degrading air quality inthe western US and identifies those regions most vulnerable to wildfire smokeand thus adverse health impacts.",12/4/2024,"['wildfires', 'wildfire', 'lightning', 'anthropogenic', 'meteorology']"
A Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for El Niño Southern Oscillation in the  Low-Data Regime,"Abstract: While deep-learning models have demonstrated skillful El Ni\~no SouthernOscillation (ENSO) forecasts up to one year in advance, they are predominantlytrained on climate model simulations that provide thousands of years oftraining data at the expense of introducing climate model biases. SimplerLinear Inverse Models (LIMs) trained on the much shorter observational recordalso make skillful ENSO predictions but do not capture predictable nonlinearprocesses. This motivates a hybrid approach, combining the LIMs modest dataneeds with a deep-learning non-Markovian correction of the LIM. For O(100 yr)datasets, our resulting Hybrid model is more skillful than the LIM while alsoexceeding the skill of a full deep-learning model. Additionally, while the mostpredictable ENSO events are still identified in advance by the LIM, they arebetter predicted by the Hybrid model, especially in the western tropicalPacific for leads beyond about 9 months, by capturing the subsequent asymmetric(warm versus cold phases) evolution of ENSO.",12/4/2024,"['southernoscillation', 'nonlinearprocesses', 'simulations', 'simplerlinear', 'predominantlytrained']"
Counter-Geoengineering: Feasibility and Policy Implications for a  Geoengineered World,"Abstract: With the increasing urgency of climate change's impacts and limited successin reducing emissions, ""geoengineering,"" or the artificial manipulation of theclimate to reduce warming rates, has been proposed as an alternative short-termsolution. Options range from taking carbon out of the atmosphere through carbonsinks and brightening clouds to increasing the planet's albedo through therelease of reflective particles into the atmosphere. While still controversial,geoengineering has been proposed by some as a promising and low-cost way ofcombating climate change. In particular, so-called 'moderate' geoengineering isclaimed to be achievable with few potential side effects or otherramifications. However, this paper argues that the effect of moderategeoengineering can easily be nullified by 'counter-geoengineering,' and anyimpactful geoengineering would require a global governance framework to preventcountries which benefit from warming temperatures from deployingcounter-geoengineering. In this paper, we take Russia as an example due to itspotential interest in counteracting geoengineering and its significant abilityto release a great amount of methane, a viable counter-geoengineering pathwayin the short term.",12/2/2024,"['geoengineering', 'moderategeoengineering', 'controversial', 'warming', 'methane']"
Coupling hotspots: distinguishing between positive and negative  land-atmosphere interaction,"Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions between land surface and atmosphere isessential to improve weather and climate predictions. Various numericalexperiments have suggested that regions of strong coupling strength (hotspots)are located in the transitional climate zones. However, atmospheric processesin these hotspots are found to have different responses to the perturbation ofsurface properties. Here we establish analytical relationships to identify keyrole of soil moisture variances in controlling the coupling hotspots. Using themost recent numerical experiments, we find different signs of feedback in twosuch hotspots, suggesting the coupling can either reinforce or attenuatepersistent extreme climates. We further uncover new coupling hotspots inregions where precipitation is highly sensitive to soil moisture perturbation.Our results highlight the importance of both signs and magnitudes ofland-atmosphere interactions over extensive regions, where the ecosystems andcommunities are particularly vulnerable to the extreme climate events.",12/4/2024,"['numericalexperiments', 'climate', 'hotspots', 'weather', 'climates']"
Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent  stratified geophysical flows via space filtering,"Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate thatstratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in thevelocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and in theoceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generatelocal turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate theenergy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existenceof regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed,for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy istransferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physicalspace. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here weinvestigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transferand exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows ofgeophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed ableto trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the couplingbetween kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on theintensity of the local vertical velocity.",12/4/2024,"['ocean', 'turbulence', 'equations', 'simulations', 'enhanced']"
Convective environments within Mediterranean cyclones,"Abstract: Understanding convective processes leading to severe weather hazards withinMediterranean cyclones is relevant for operational forecasters, insuranceindustry, and enhancing societal preparedness. In this work we examine theclimatological link between Mediterranean cyclones and atmospheric conditionsconducive to the formation of severe convection and convective hazards(convective precipitation, lightning and hail potential). Using ATDnetlightning detections we find that, from autumn to spring, 20 to 60% oflightning hours over the Mediterranean basin and adjacent land regions areassociated with the presence of a nearby cyclone. Based on reanalysis data,severe convective environments, deep, moist convection (i.e., lightningpotential) and related hazards are frequent in the warm sector of Mediterraneancyclones and to the north-east of their centres. In agreement with previousliterature, convective processes and hazards peak approximately six hours priorto the time of minimum pressure of the cyclone centre. Moreover, severeconvective environments are often detected in cyclone categories typical oftransition seasons (especially autumn) and summer, while they are rarer in deepbaroclinic cyclones with peak occurrence during winter. Finally, we show thatdynamical cyclone features distinguish regions favourable to deep, moistconvection. Warm conveyor belts of Mediterranean cyclones, characterised bylarge-scale ascent and located in regions of high thermodynamic instability,have the largest lightning potential. The potential is only half as intensealong the cyclones' cold fronts.",12/3/2024,"['cyclones', 'cyclone', 'lightning', 'lightningpotential', 'severeconvective']"
Advancing global aerosol forecasting with artificial intelligence,"Abstract: Aerosol forecasting is essential for air quality warnings, health riskassessment, and climate change mitigation. However, it is more complex thanweather forecasting due to the intricate interactions between aerosolphysicochemical processes and atmospheric dynamics, resulting in significantuncertainty and high computational costs. Here, we develop an artificialintelligence-driven global aerosol-meteorology forecasting system (AI-GAMFS),which provides reliable 5-day, 3-hourly forecasts of aerosol optical componentsand surface concentrations at a 0.5{\deg} x 0.625{\deg} resolution. AI-GAMFScombines Vision Transformer and U-Net in a backbone network, robustly capturingthe complex aerosol-meteorology interactions via global attention andspatiotemporal encoding. Trained on 42 years of advanced aerosol reanalysisdata and initialized with GEOS Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) analyses, AI-GAMFSdelivers operational 5-day forecasts in one minute. It outperforms theCopernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global forecasting system,GEOS-FP forecasts, and several regional dust forecasting systems in forecastingmost aerosol variables including aerosol optical depth and dust components.

CA-MoE: Channel-Adapted MoE for Incremental Weather Forecasting,"Abstract: Atmospheric science is intricately connected with other fields, e.g.,geography and aerospace. Most existing approaches involve training a jointatmospheric and geographic model from scratch, which incurs significantcomputational costs and overlooks the potential for incremental learning ofweather variables across different domains. In this paper, we introduceincremental learning to weather forecasting and propose a novel structure thatallows for the flexible expansion of variables within the model. Specifically,our method presents a Channel-Adapted MoE (CA-MoE) that employs adivide-and-conquer strategy. This strategy assigns variable training tasks todifferent experts by index embedding and reduces computational complexitythrough a channel-wise Top-K strategy. Experiments conducted on the widelyutilized ERA5 dataset reveal that our method, utilizing only approximately 15\%of trainable parameters during the incremental stage, attains performance thatis on par with state-of-the-art competitors.

Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations,"Abstract: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozoneaccording to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient AirQuality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) andvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozoneformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined asthe sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of$\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, andozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ speciesin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid ingenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background orregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport ofprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozoneconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of localprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrationsare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regionaland local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used todetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whetherthe region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis isperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in theoxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utahwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most countiesbeing either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Localcontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt LakeCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidantconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regionaland local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires wasfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regimeto be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.",12/2/2024,"['epa', 'utah', 'utahwere', 'ozoneconcentrations', 'wildfires']"
Smoothing of global fields,"Abstract: In the forecast diagnostic and verification community, there exists a needfor smoothing methods that would work in the global domain. For limited-areadomains, fast smoothing methods already exist, but the problem is that theseapproaches cannot be used with global fields as a global grid defined on asphere is inherently non-equidistant and/or irregular. Another potential issueis the variability of grid point area sizes and the presence of missing data inthe field, which can also be problematic to deal with for existing smoothingmethods. Here, we present two new approaches for area-size-informed smoothingon a sphere. The first approach is based on k-d trees, and the second one isbased on overlap detection. While each has its strengths and weaknesses, bothare potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution globalfields feasible, as demonstrated by the smoothing of an operational globalhigh-resolution precipitation forecast from the Integrated Forecasting Systemof the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Both approaches canalso handle missing data in an appropriate manner and can also be used innon-rectangularly-shaped limited-area domains defined on non-equidistant and/orirregular grids.",12/1/2024,"['globalfields', 'smoothingmethods', 'globalhigh', 'weaknesses', 'theseapproaches']"
Jacobian-Enforced Neural Networks (JENN) for Improved Data Assimilation  Consistency in Dynamical Models,"Abstract: Machine learning-based weather models have shown great promise in producingaccurate forecasts but have struggled when applied to data assimilation tasks,unlike traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This studyintroduces the Jacobian-Enforced Neural Network (JENN) framework, designed toenhance DA consistency in neural network (NN)-emulated dynamical systems. Usingthe Lorenz 96 model as an example, the approach demonstrates improvedapplicability of NNs in DA through explicit enforcement of Jacobianrelationships. The NN architecture includes an input layer of 40 neurons, twohidden layers with 256 units each employing hyperbolic tangent activationfunctions, and an output layer of 40 neurons without activation.The JENN framework employs a two-step training process: an initial phaseusing standard prediction-label pairs to establish baseline forecastcapability, followed by a secondary phase incorporating a customized lossfunction to enforce accurate Jacobian relationships. This loss functioncombines root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and true state valueswith additional RMSE terms for tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) emulationresults, weighted to balance forecast accuracy and Jacobian sensitivity. Toensure consistency, the secondary training phase uses additional pairs of TL/ADinputs and labels calculated from the physical models. Notably, this approachdoes not require starting from scratch or structural modifications to the NN,making it readily applicable to pretrained models such as GraphCast, NeuralGCM,Pangu, or FuXi, facilitating their adaptation for DA tasks with minimalreconfiguration. Experimental results demonstrate that the JENN frameworkpreserves nonlinear forecast performance while significantly reducing noise inthe TL and AD components, as well as in the overall Jacobian matrix.",12/2/2024,"['forecastcapability', 'graphcast', 'improvedapplicability', 'studyintroduces', 'weather']"
Internal tides in the Mediterranean Sea,"Abstract: The generation and propagation sites of internal tides in the MediterraneanSea are mapped through a comprehensive high-resolution numerical study. Twoocean general circulation models were used for this: NEMO v3.6, and ICON-O,both hydrostatic ocean models based on primitive equations with Boussinesqapproximation, where NEMO is a regional Mediterranean Sea model with anAtlantic box, and ICON a global model. Internal tides are widespread in theMediterranean Sea. The primary generation sites: the Gibraltar Strait, SicilyStrait/Malta Bank, and Hellenic Arc, are mapped through analysis of the tidalbarotropic to baroclinic energy conversion. Semidiurnal internal tides canpropagate for hundreds of kilometres from these generation sites into theAlgerian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, and Ionian Sea respectively. Diurnal internaltides remain trapped along the bathymetry, and are generated in the centralMediterranean Sea and southeastern coasts of the basin. The total energy usedfor internal tide generation in the Mediterranean Sea is 2.89 GW in NEMO and1.36 GW in ICON.

Learning Surrogate Rainfall-driven Inundation Models with Few Data,"Abstract: Flood hazard assessment demands fast and accurate predictions. Hydrodynamicmodels are detailed but computationally intensive, making them impractical forquantifying uncertainty or identifying extremes. In contrast, machine learningsurrogates can be rapid, but training on scarce simulated or observed extremedata can also be ineffective. This work demonstrates the development of aneffective surrogate model for flood hazard prediction by initializing deeplearning (ResNet-18) with ensemble-approximated Conditional Gaussian Processes(EnsCGP) and finalizing it with a bias correction. The proposed methodologycouples EnsCGP with a ResNet-18 architecture to estimate flood depth and usesensemble optimal estimation for bias correction. The surrogate model wastrained and evaluated using rainfall data from Daymet and hydrodynamicsimulations from LISFLOOD-FP, spanning the period from 1981 to 2019. Thetraining involved using data up to a certain year and testing on the subsequentyear, iteratively progressing through the dataset. This process requiredapproximately 100 training iterations and extensive data. Inundation depths areestimated rapidly at runtime (approximately 0.006 seconds per event). Resultsover multiple years in the current climate over Chicago demonstrate an averageR-squared greater than 0.96, with median relative errors in flood depthestimates of about 1 percent.",11/28/2024,"['hydrodynamicsimulations', 'hydrodynamicmodels', 'requiredapproximately', 'deeplearning', 'fast']"
Multi-model evidence of future tropical Atlantic precipitation change  modulated by AMOC decline,"Abstract: Projections from global climate models reveal a significant inter-modelspread in future rainfall changes in the tropical Atlantic by the end of the21st century, including alterations to the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ) and monsoonal regions. While existing studies have identified varioussources of uncertainty, our research uncovers a prominent role played by thedecline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for theinter-model spread. Firstly we examine 30 climate model simulations (using thessp5-8.5 scenario) from the CMIP6 archive and show that models that present amore substantial AMOC decline exhibit an equatorward shift of the ascendingbranch of the Atlantic regional Hadley circulation, resulting in a southwarddisplacement of the ITCZ. Conversely, models characterized by a smaller AMOCdecline do not indicate any ITCZ displacement. Secondly, we use targetedexperiments (using the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment) to specifically isolate theeffects of a weakened AMOC from the changes in precipitation that would occurif, under continuous global warming, the AMOC did not weaken. Our resultsdemonstrate that net precipitation anomalies in the abrupt 4xCO2 experimentsare displaced southwards compared to the simulation with fixed AMOC strength,corroborating our previous findings. Our study has implications forunderstanding the mechanisms driving future changes in tropical Atlanticprecipitation, and underscores the central role played by the AMOC in futureclimate change.",11/28/2024,"['atlanticprecipitation', 'futureclimate', 'intertropical', 'monsoonal', 'atlantic']"
Assessing the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning and  physics-informed machine learning in predicting sea surface temperature,"Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in modelling atmospheric andoceanic processes offers a promising alternative to traditional numericalmethods.

Improving sub-seasonal wind-speed forecasts in Europe with a non-linear  model,"Abstract: Sub-seasonal wind speed forecasts provide valuable guidance for wind powersystem planning and operations, yet the forecasting skills of surface windsdecrease sharply after two weeks. However, large-scale variables exhibitgreater predictability on this time scale. This study explores the potential ofleveraging non-linear relationships between 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500)and surface wind speed to improve subs-seasonal wind speed forecasting skillsin Europe. Our proposed framework uses a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or aConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress surface wind speed from Z500.Evaluations on ERA5 reanalysis indicate that the CNN performs better due totheir non-linearity. Applying these models to sub-seasonal forecasts from theEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, various verificationmetrics demonstrate the advantages of non-linearity. Yet, this is partlyexplained by the fact that these statistical models are under-dispersive sincethey explain only a fraction of the target variable variance. Introducingstochastic perturbations to represent the stochasticity of the unexplained partfrom the signal helps compensate for this issue. Results show that theperturbed CNN performs better than the perturbed MLR only in the first weeks,while the perturbed MLR's performance converges towards that of the perturbedCNN after two weeks. The study finds that introducing stochastic perturbationscan address the issue of insufficient spread in these statistical models, withimprovements from the non-linearity varying with the lead time of theforecasts.",11/28/2024,"['windsdecrease', 'introducingstochastic', 'reanalysis', 'verificationmetrics', 'wind']"
Assessing the physical risks of climate change for the financial sector:  a case study from Mexico's Central Bank,"Abstract: The financial sector is increasingly concerned with the physical risks ofclimate change, but economic and financial impact representations are stilldeveloping, particularly for chronic risks. Mexico's Central Bank conducted acomprehensive assessment using a suite of global models to evaluate bothphysical and transition risks. We present the analysis concerning with chronicphysical risks, underlining innovations such as the use of a recent integratedassessment model that enables grid-cell level analysis and differentiates urbanand non-urban areas, capturing the local effects of climate change moreaccurately. The model includes multiple damage functions and a probabilisticclimate model for encompassing analyses and detailed economic impact insights.Under the Current Policies scenario, economic losses could exceed 35 percent ofMexico's GDP by 2100. Accounting for the urban heat island effect, losses couldsurpass 20 trillion (USD) in present value, over ten times Mexico's 2024 GDP.However, implementing a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement significantlyreduces these losses, showcasing the benefits of international mitigationefforts, though substantial residual impacts persist.

The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) methodand the large-scale relativistic configuration-interaction (CI) method havebeen employed in order to take into account electron correlation effects on thewavelengths and transition rates. It was found that the wavelengths andtransition rates obtained from the MCDHF-CI method depend strongly on the sizeand the type of the active space used in the calculations. It has been foundthat extending the active space of orbitals without careful control of theconfiguration state function base does not always lead to good quality MCDHF-CIresults for highly ionized tungsten ions.,5/15/2024,"['tungsten', 'ionized', 'electron', 'ions', 'dirac']"
Frequency-tunable biphoton generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing,"Abstract: We present experimental results on tuning biphoton frequency by introducing adetuned coupling field in spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), and examine itsimpact on the pairing ratio. This tunability is achieved by manipulating theinherent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in thedouble-$\Lambda$ scheme. Introducing a detuned coupling field degrades theefficiency of EIT-based stimulated four-wave mixing, which in turn reduces thebiphoton pairing ratio. However, this reduction can be mitigated by increasingthe optical power of the coupling field. Additionally, we observe that blue-and red-detuning the biphoton frequency results in distinct temporal profilesof biphoton wavepackets due to phase mismatch. These findings provide insightsinto the mechanisms of frequency-tunable biphoton generation via SFWM, andsuggest potential optimizations for applications in quantum communication andinformation processing.",12/5/2024,"['mismatch', 'mixing', 'optimizations', 'mitigated', 'thebiphoton']"
Negative refraction of light in an atomic medium,"Abstract: The quest to manipulate light propagation in ways not possible with naturalmedia has driven the development of artificially structured metamaterials. Oneof the most striking effects is negative refraction, where the light beamdeflects away from the boundary normal. However, due to materialcharacteristics, the applications of this phenomenon, such as lensing thatsurpasses the diffraction limit, have been constrained. Here, we demonstratenegative refraction of light in an atomic medium without the use of artificialmetamaterials, employing essentially exact simulations of light propagation.High transmission negative refraction is achieved in atomic arrays fordifferent level structures and lattice constants, within the scope of currentlyrealised experimental systems. We introduce an intuitive description ofnegative refraction based on collective excitation bands, whose transversegroup velocities are antiparallel to the excitation quasi-momenta. We alsoillustrate how this phenomenon is robust to lattice imperfections and can besignificantly enhanced through subradiance.",12/4/2024,"['materialcharacteristics', 'artificialmetamaterials', 'refraction', 'diffraction', 'beamdeflects']"
Soft Checksums to Flag Untrustworthy Machine Learning Surrogate  Predictions and Application to Atomic Physics Simulations,"Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) are attractive as surrogate models to replacecostly calculations in physical simulations, but are often unknowingly appliedto states not adequately represented in the training dataset. We present thenovel technique of soft checksums for scientific machine learning, ageneral-purpose method to differentiate between trustworthy predictions withsmall errors on in-distribution (ID) data points, and untrustworthy predictionswith large errors on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. By adding a checknode to the existing output layer, we train the model to learn the chosenchecksum function encoded within the NN predictions and show that violations ofthis function correlate with high prediction errors. As the checksum functiondepends only on the NN predictions, we can calculate the checksum error for anyprediction with a single forward pass, incurring negligible time and memorycosts. Additionally, we find that incorporating the checksum function into theloss function and exposing the NN to OOD data points during the trainingprocess improves separation between ID and OOD predictions. By applying softchecksums to a physically complex and high-dimensional non-local thermodynamicequilibrium atomic physics dataset, we show that a well-chosen thresholdchecksum error can effectively separate ID and OOD predictions.",12/4/2024,"['trainingprocess', 'memorycosts', 'scientific', 'neural', 'simulations']"
Sensitive Low-Recoil VUV 1+1$'$ REMPI Detection of ND$_3$,"Abstract: In molecular beam scattering experiments, an important technique formeasuring product energy and angular distributions is velocity map imagingfollowing photoionization. For studies with cold molecular beams, theresolution is often limited by the product detection process. Whenstate-selective ionization detection is used, excess photon energy can transferto kinetic energy in the molecular ion-electron pair, resulting in measurablecation recoil. With advanced molecular beam technology, velocity spreads assmall as a few m/s are possible. Thus, a suitable product detection scheme mustbe not only sensitive, state-selective, and background-free, it must alsoproduce less cation recoil than the velocity spread of the molecular beams. Todate this has only been possible with the NO molecule. Our goal here is toextend this low-recoil capability to fully deuterated ammonia, ND$_3$. Wepresent a resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) detection schemefor ND$_3$, that imparts sufficiently low ion recoil, allowing, for the firsttime, high-resolution imaging of ND$_3$ products in a cold ND$_3$-HD scatteringexperiment. The first step of the 1+1$'$ REMPI scheme requires vacuumultra-violet (VUV) photons of ~160 nm, which are generated throughfour-wave-mixing in Xe. We varied the wavelength of the second, ionization stepbetween 434 and 458 nm, exciting ND$_3$ to a wide range of autoionizing neutralstates. By velocity mapping the resulting photoelectrons, it was possible tofully chart the ion recoil across this range with vibrational resolution forthe final ionic states. Additionally, rotational resolution in thephotoionization dynamics was achieved for selected excitation energies near oneof the vibrational thresholds. Many of the peaks in the spectrum ofautoionizing Rydberg states are assigned to specific Rydberg series using asimple Rydberg formula model.",12/3/2024,"['photoelectrons', 'photoionization', 'imagingfollowing', 'scatteringexperiment', 'ionization']"
Analytical and numerical studies of periodic superradiance,"Abstract: We conduct a theoretical study to understand the periodic superradianceobserved in an Er:YSO crystal. First, we construct a model based on theMaxwell-Bloch equations for a reduced level system, a pair of superradiancestates and a population reservoir state. We then derive two-variable equationsconsisting of the coherence and population difference between the twosuperradiance states, which contain the essential feature of the periodicsuperradiance. The two-variable equations clarify a mathematical structure ofthis periodic phenomenon and give analytical forms of the period, pulseduration, and number of emitted photons. Furthermore, analysis of theeigenvalues of the linearized differential equations shows that periodicsuperradiance can be realized only for certain parameters. Our modelsuccessfully reproduces the periodic behavior, but the actual experimentalparameters are found to be outside the parameter region for the periodicsuperradiance. This result implies that some other mechanism(s) is required. Asone example, assuming that the field decay rate varies with the electric field,the periodic superradiance can be reproduced even under the actual experimentalcondition.",12/3/2024,"['equationsconsisting', 'experimentalparameters', 'equations', 'mathematical', 'experimentalcondition']"

As electrons pass through a dilutevapor of rubidium atoms, their magnetic field perturb the atomic spin's quantumstate and causes polarization rotation of a laser resonant with an opticaltransition of the atoms. By measuring the polarization rotation angle acrossthe laser beam, we recreate a 2D projection of the magnetic field and use it todetermine the e-beam position, size and total current. We tested this methodfor an e-beam with currents ranging from 30 to 110 {\mu}A. Our approach isinsensitive to electron kinetic energy, and we confirmed that experimentallybetween 10 to 20 keV.

Single-atom resolved collective spectroscopy of a one-dimensional atomic  array,"Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical responsecompared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference inresonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of alarge shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In thelinear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shiftof the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. Forstronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering thecalculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding isimportant for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks.Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of aone-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrowintercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomicstate with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linearoptics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due todipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomicdistance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation isdistributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramseyspectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe atime-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between thecollective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in thelarge-excitation case.",12/3/2024,"['spectroscopic', 'spectroscopy', 'ramseyspectroscopy', 'interatomicdistance', 'optics']"

Self-energy correction to the E1 transition amplitudes in hydrogen-like  ions,"Abstract: We present calculations of the self-energy correction to the $E1$ transitionamplitudes in hydrogen-like ions, performed to all orders in the nuclearbinding strength parameter. Our results for the $1s$-$2p_{1/2}$ transition forthe hydrogen isoelectronic sequence show that the perturbed-orbital part of theself-energy correction provides the dominant contribution, accounting forapproximately 99\% of the total correction for this transition. Detailedcalculations were performed for $ns$-$n'p$ and $np$-$n'd$ transitions in H-likecaesium. We conclude that the perturbed-orbital part remains dominant also forother $ns$-$n'p$ transitions, whereas for the $np$-$n'd$ matrix elements thisdominance no longer holds. Consequently, the self-energy corrections for the$np$-$n'd$ one-electron matrix elements cannot be well reproduced by means ofeffective QED operators constructed for energy levels.",12/2/2024,"['nuclearbinding', 'detailedcalculations', 'isoelectronic', 'hydrogen', 'electron']"

Both our measurements and \emph{ab initio} simulations of the angledfour-wave-mixing signal show a double-peak structure in delay dependence, inexcellent agreement with each other.

Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold  atomic collisions,"Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracoldinelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectablequantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from variousinelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling""configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and staticelectric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-couplingcalculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate ourproposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-bodyloss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters.Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficientexhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near themagnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which arf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns becomeincreasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields.

Two-Photon Optical Ramsey-Doppler Spectroscopy of Positronium and  Muonium,"Abstract: Positronium and muonium, as purely leptonic atoms without internal structure,provide ideal systems for high-precision tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED)and measurements of fundamental constants. However, the high velocities ofthese lightweight atoms complicate precision spectroscopy, particularly in the1S-2S transition, due to transit time broadening and second-order Dopplershifts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method combiningtwo-photon Ramsey spectroscopy with a technique to correct the second-orderDoppler shifts on an atom-by-atom basis. Additionally, this approach suppressessystematic effects of the AC Stark shift to a negligible level compared to thetarget precision. Simulations predict that for both positronium and muonium,this method could improve the measurement precision of the 1S-2S transition bymore than two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art.This approach opens up new avenues for rigorous bound-state QED tests andsearches for physics beyond the Standard Model.",11/29/2024,"['physics', 'quantum', 'spectroscopy', 'electrodynamics', 'leptonic']"

Using the strong-field approximation,we assess how the symmetries of the field influence the dominant events.Furthermore, we show that, by manipulating the field parameters such as thefield frequencies and relative phase between the two driving waves, one caninfluence the correlated electron-momentum distributions. Specific features ofa linearly polarized bichromatic field are that the momentum distributions ofthe second electron are no longer centered around vanishing momenta and thatthere may be more than one ionization event per half cycle. This can be used toconfine the RESI distributions to specific momentum regions and to determine ahierarchy of parameters that make an event dominant.",11/29/2024,"['laser', 'ionization', 'bichromatic', 'linearlypolarized', 'electron']"

Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph whichcontains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets,which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct thepotential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to thegraph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system.

Photoelectron circular dichroism of a chiral molecule induced by  resonant interatomic Coulombic decay from an antenna atom,"Abstract: We show that a nonchiral atom can act as an antenna to induce a photoelectroncircular dichroism in a nearby chiral molecule in a three-step process: Thedonor atom (antenna) is initially resonantly excited by circularly polarizedradiation. It then transfers its excess energy to the acceptor molecule bymeans of resonant interatomic Coulombic decay. The latter finally absorbs theenergy and emits an electron which exhibits the aforementioned circulardichroism in its angular distribution. We study the process on the basis of theretarded dipole--dipole interaction and report an asymptotic analyticexpression for the distance-dependent chiral asymmetry of the photoelectron asinduced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay for random line-of-sight andacceptor orientations. In the nonretarded limit, the predicted chiral asymmetryis reversed as compared to that of a direct photoelectron circular dichroism ofthe molecule.",12/3/2024,"['photoelectron', 'photoelectroncircular', 'antenna', 'interatomic', 'electron']"
Real-time tracking the energy flow in cluster formation,"Abstract: While photodissociation of molecular systems has been extensively studied,the photoinduced formation of chemical bonds remains largely unexplored.Especially for larger aggregates, the electronic and nuclear dynamics involvedin the cluster formation process remain elusive. This limitation is rooted indifficulties to prepare reactants at well-defined initial conditions. Here, weovercome this hurdle by exploiting the exceptional solvation properties ofhelium nanodroplets. We load the droplets with Mg atoms and investigate thedynamical response of the formed Mg$_n$ aggregates to photoexcitation withtime-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Beside the response expected forconventional Mg$_n$ clusters, consisting of a prompt signal rise and a decaycharacteristic for van der Waals bonds, the transient spectra also show adelayed photoelectron band peaking at 1.2 ps. This delayed signal rise ischaracteristic for nuclear dynamics and represents the transition of Mg$_n$aggregates from a metastable, foam-like configuration, where Mg atoms arestabilized with a previously predicted interatomic spacing of 9.5 A, to acompact cluster. With global fitting analysis and ion-electron coincidencedetection, the concerted electronic and nuclear dynamics can be tracked on a fstimescale. We find that cluster formation, proceeding with a ($450\pm180$) fstime constant, is accompanied by the population of highly-excited atomicstates. We propose an energy pooling reaction in collisions of two or moreexcited Mg atoms during cluster formation as the mechanism leading topopulation of these high-lying Mg states. Additionally, conversion to kineticenergy through electronic relaxation leads to fragmentation and ejection ofionic cluster fragments from the He droplet.

"Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a  chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials","Abstract: Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phaseapplications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) oratom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lackchemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and thecomputational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fullyachieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of bothapproaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and forcefield-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation,where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningfulmonomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structuraldescriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effectiveinteractions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feedforward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematicassessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquidCO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide anew route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scalequantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.",11/30/2024,"['polynomial', 'neural', 'atomistic', 'molecular', 'chemically']"
Quantum mechanical deconstruction of vibrational energy transfer rate  and pathways modified by collective vibrational strong coupling,"Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling (VSC)between molecular vibrations and the optical cavity field can modifyvibrational energy transfer (VET) processes in molecular systems. However, theunderlying mechanisms and the behavior of individual molecules under collectiveVSC remain largely incomplete. In this work, we combine state-of-the-artquantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamicssimulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how thevibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the(H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSCbreaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches,and opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving bothneighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET processrelies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of thecorresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathwaysis found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OHstretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in modecoupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirmand extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes butalso provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.",11/22/2024,"['dynamicssimulations', 'quantum', 'bothneighboring', 'experiments', 'theoretical']"
Time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging of vibrational wave packets in  alkali dimers on helium nanodroplets,"Abstract: Vibrational wave packets are created in the lowest triplet state \triplet of$\mathrm{K_2}$ and $\mathrm{Rb_2}$ residing on the surface of heliumnanodroplets, through non-resonant stimulated impulsive Raman scatteringinduced by a moderately intense near-infrared laser pulse. A delayed, intense50-fs laser pulse doubly ionizes the alkali dimers via multiphoton absorptionand thereby causes them to Coulomb explode into a pair of alkali ions$\mathrm{Ak^+}$. From the kinetic energy distribution $P(E_\mathrm{kin})$ ofthe $\mathrm{Ak^+}$ fragment ions, measured at a large number of delays, wedetermine the time-dependent internuclear distribution $P(R,t)$, whichrepresents the modulus square of the wave packet within the accuracy of theexperiment. For both $\mathrm{K_2}$ and $\mathrm{Rb_2}$, $P(R,t)$ exhibits aperiodic oscillatory structure throughout the respective 300 ps and 100 psobservation times. The oscillatory structure is reflected in the time-dependentmean value of $R$, $\langle R \rangle(t)$. Fourier transformation of $\langle R\rangle(t)$ shows that the wave packets are composed mainly of the vibrationalground state and the first excited vibrational state, in agreement withnumerical simulations. In the case of $\mathrm{K_2}$, the oscillations areobserved for 300 ps corresponding to more than 180 vibrational periods with anamplitude that decreases gradually from 0.035 {\AA} to 0.020 {\AA}. Usingtime-resolved spectral analysis, we find that the decay time of the amplitudeis $\sim$ 260 ps. The decrease is ascribed to the weak coupling between thevibrating dimers and the droplet.",11/19/2024,"['laser', 'heliumnanodroplets', 'triplet', 'ionizes', 'multiphoton']"
Optimal Snake Locomotion on Flat Surfaces: An Analytical Framework,"Abstract: In this theoretical study, we present an analytical framework to investigatethe slithering motion of snakes on flat surfaces. While previous studies havepredominantly relied on numerical methods to identify optimal locomotionkinematics, such approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and thenumber of kinematic parameters in the model. Here, we derive analyticalsolutions for optimal kinematics that minimize the cost of transport ormaximize the velocity under varying friction anisotropy conditions. Ouranalysis assumes a uniform weight distribution and negligible body rigidity,though the framework can be extended to more complex scenarios. Furthermore, wedemonstrate the applicability of this approach to the undulatory motion ofother elongated bodies in various media, where interactive forces can bedescribed using resistive force theory, such as swimming through sand orviscous fluids.",12/4/2024,"['snakes', 'kinematics', 'locomotionkinematics', 'kinematic', 'analyticalsolutions']"
Physics-informed Deep Learning for Muscle Force Prediction with  Unlabeled sEMG Signals,"Abstract: Computational biomechanical analysis plays a pivotal role in understandingand improving human movements and physical functions. Although physics-basedmodeling methods can interpret the dynamic interaction between the neural driveto muscle dynamics and joint kinematics, they suffer from high computationallatency. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promisingalternative due to their fast execution speed, but label information is stillrequired during training, which is not easy to acquire in practice. To tacklethese issues, this paper presents a novel physics-informed deep learning methodto predict muscle forces without any label information during model training.In addition, the proposed method could also identify personalized muscle-tendonparameters. To achieve this, the Hill muscle model-based forward dynamics isembedded into the deep neural network as the additional loss to furtherregulate the behavior of the deep neural network. Experimental validations onthe wrist joint from six healthy subjects are performed, and a fully connectedneural network (FNN) is selected to implement the proposed method. Thepredicted results of muscle forces show comparable or even lower root meansquare error (RMSE) and higher coefficient of determination compared withbaseline methods, which have to use the labeled surface electromyography (sEMG)signals, and it can also identify muscle-tendon parameters accurately,demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed deep learningmethod.",12/5/2024,"['physics', 'electromyography', 'biomechanical', 'learningmethod', 'kinematics']"

A Note on Spectral Map,"Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transitions between states are oftenrare events due to energy barriers that exceed the thermal temperature. Becauseof their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom inmolecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare eventsis immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose acollective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplifiedrepresentation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies onphysical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promisingapproach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we providea note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructsCVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables inthe system.",12/5/2024,"['difficult', 'fast', 'simplifiedrepresentation', 'oftenrare', 'simulations']"
Electrically functionalized body surface for deep-tissue bioelectrical  recording,"Abstract: Directly probing deep tissue activities from body surfaces offers anoninvasive approach to monitoring essential physiological processes1-3.However, this method is technically challenged by rapid signal attenuationtoward the body surface and confounding motion artifacts4-6 primarily due toexcessive contact impedance and mechanical mismatch with conventionalelectrodes. Herein, by formulating and directly spray coating biocompatibletwo-dimensional nanosheet ink onto the human body under ambient conditions, wecreate microscopically conformal and adaptive van der Waals thin films (VDWTFs)that seamlessly merge with non-Euclidean, hairy, and dynamically evolving bodysurfaces. Unlike traditional deposition methods, which often struggle withconformality and adaptability while retaining high electronic performance, thisgentle process enables the formation of high-performance VDWTFs directly on thebody surface under bio-friendly conditions, making it ideal for biologicalapplications. This results in low-impedance electrically functionalized bodysurfaces (EFBS), enabling highly robust monitoring of biopotential andbioimpedance modulations associated with deep-tissue activities, such as bloodcirculation, muscle movements, and brain activities. Compared to commercialsolutions, our VDWTF-EFBS exhibits nearly two-orders of magnitude lower contactimpedance and substantially reduces the extrinsic motion artifacts, enablingreliable extraction of bioelectrical signals from irregular surfaces, such asunshaved human scalps. This advancement defines a technology for continuous,noninvasive monitoring of deep-tissue activities during routine body movements.",12/4/2024,"['biocompatibletwo', 'bodysurfaces', 'biologicalapplications', 'bloodcirculation', 'bioelectrical']"

Social patch foraging theory in an egalitarian group,"Abstract: Foraging is a widespread behavior, and being part of a group may bringseveral benefits compared to solitary foraging, such as collective pooling ofinformation and reducing environmental uncertainty. Often theoretical models ofcollective behavior use coarse-grained representations, or are too complex foranalytical treatment, and generally do not take into account the noisy decisionmaking process implemented by individual agents. This calls for the developmentof a mechanistic, analytically tractable, and stochastic framework to study theunderlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic to themacroscopic levels. Based on an evidence accumulation framework, we developed amodel of patch-leaving decisions in a large egalitarian group. Across a varietyof environmental statistics and information sharing mechanisms, we were able toanalytically derive optimal agent strategies. The environmental statisticsconsidered are either two non-depleting or several successive depletingpatches. The social information sharing mechanisms are either throughobservation of others' food rewards or through belief sharing, with continuoussharing, pulsatile observation of others' departures or arrivals, or throughcounting the number of individuals in a patch. Throughout all these conditions,we quantified how cohesive a group is over time, how much time agents spend onaverage in a patch and what are their group equilibrium dynamics. We found thatsocial coupling strongly modulates these features across a variety ofenvironmental statistics. This general modeling framework is crucial to bothdesigning social foraging experiments and generating hypotheses that can betested. Moreover, this framework can be extended to groups exhibitinghierarchical relations.",12/3/2024,"['foraging', 'mechanistic', 'food', 'hypotheses', 'foranalytical']"
Strong localization blurs criticality of time series for spreading  phenomena on networks,"Abstract: We analyze critical time series of the order parameter generated with activeto inactive phase transitions of spreading dynamics running on the top ofheterogeneous networks. Different activation mechanisms that govern thedynamics near the critical point were investigated. The time series wereanalyzed using the visibility graph (VG) method where a disassortative degreecorrelation of the VG is a signature of criticality. In contrast, assortativecorrelation is associated with offcritical dynamics. The signature ofcriticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena,as in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activationdriven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-coredecomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by theVG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributedhubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for hugesystems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presenceof rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-criticalseries, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remaingood proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-coreactivation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures ofor, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality oftime series.",11/21/2024,"['wereanalyzed', 'assortativecorrelation', 'criticalseries', 'distributedhubs', 'activationdriven']"
Cargo Delivery to Cells Using Laser-Irradiated Carbon-Black-Loaded PDMS,"Abstract: Effective intracellular delivery is essential for successful gene editing ofcells.

This low-cost, biocompatiblematerial, coupled with an optical approach, enables scalable, spatiallyselective, and sequential delivery of multiple cargo molecules, includingFITC-dextran and siRNA, to a broad range of cells.

The matter/life nexus in biological cells,"Abstract: Physical motion has long been at the heart of what humans identify as life.Early thinkers about what differentiates life from inanimate matter connectedagency to autonomous motion, a line of thinking that continued until RobertBrown's experiments showed decisively that autonomous motion, and many otherphysical behaviors and organizational principles, belong to inanimate matter.An incredible trajectory of inquiry for the next 100 years showed that life ischaracterized by the ability to reproduce, to inherit, to adapt. But throughoutthis arc, a persistent search continued for that fundamental process, that gainin function from matter to life. Subsequent decades showed that geneticsequence is not enough. The leap occurs somewhere in cells' watery milieu -physicochemical functions unique to life. In this Review, we explore howadvances in the last decade have embraced the deep coupling of physics andcellular biochemistry to shed light on the matter/life nexus. Brownian flowphysics are more than implicated but rather help instantiate life. The readerwill observe in this review many references to works in cell biology - as manyor more than in biophysics or fluid mechanics.

Self organisation of invasive breast cancer driven by the interplay of  active and passive nematic dynamics,"Abstract: In invasive breast cancer, cell clusters of varying sizes and shapes areembedded in the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM). Although the prevailingview attributes this structure to increasing disorder resulting from loss offunction and dedifferentiation, our findings reveal that it arises through aprocess of active self-organization driven by cancer cell motility. Simulationsand histological analyses of tumours from over 2,000 breast cancer patientsreveal that motile, aligned cancer cells within clusters move as active nematicaggregates through the surrounding highly aligned ECM fibres, which form aconfining, passive nematic phase. Cellular motion leads to cluster splittingand coalescence. The degree of cluster activity, combined with heterogeneity incell motility, is reflected in specific scaling behaviours for cluster shape,size distribution, and the distance between cluster boundaries and nematicdefects in ECM alignment. Increased activity estimates correlate with tumourprogression and are associated with a poorer prognosis for patients.",12/2/2024,"['cancer', 'tumours', 'tumourprogression', 'patientsreveal', 'extracellular']"
Chemomechanical regulation of growing tissues from a  thermodynamically-consistent framework and its application to tumor spheroid  growth,"Abstract: It is widely recognized that reciprocal interactions between cells and theirmicroenvironment, via mechanical forces and biochemical signaling pathways,regulate cell behaviors during normal development, homeostasis and diseaseprogression such as cancer. However, it is still not well understood howcomplex patterns of tissue growth emerge. Here, we propose a framework for thechemomechanical regulation of growth based on thermodynamics of continua andgrowth-elasticity to predict growth patterns. Combining the elastic andchemical energies, we use an energy variational approach to derive a novelformulation that incorporates an energy-dissipating stress relaxation andbiochemomechanical regulation of the volumetric growth rate. We validate themodel using experimental data from growth of tumor spheroids in confinedenvironments. We also investigate the influence of model parameters, includingtissue rearrangement rate, tissue compressibility, strength of mechanicalfeedback and external mechanical stimuli, on the growth patterns of tumorspheroids.",12/1/2024,"['cancer', 'thermodynamics', 'biochemical', 'tumor', 'tumorspheroids']"
Messenger size optimality in cellular communications,"Abstract: Living cells presumably employ optimized information transfer methods,enabling efficient communication even in noisy environments. As expected, theefficiency of chemical communications between cells depends on the propertiesof the molecular messenger. Evidence suggests that proteins from narrow rangesof molecular masses have been naturally selected to mediate cellularcommunications, yet the underlying communication design principles are notunderstood. Using a simple physical model that considers the cost of chemicalsynthesis, diffusion, molecular binding, and degradation, we show that optimalmass values exist that ensure efficient communication of various types ofsignals.

Intermittent turbulent gusts lift eagles,"Abstract: Turbulence grounds aircraft and combating it in flight requires energy, yetvolant wildlife fly effortlessly even on windy days. The nature of theinteractions between soaring birds and transient turbulent gusts is not clear,especially when compared with our understanding of flight in larger andsteadier airflows during thermal or dynamic soaring. We show that soaringgolden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) experienced short upward accelerationsindicative of preferential engagement with strong and intermittent turbulentupdrafts. The vertical accelerations reflect changes in lift that were as largeas 25 standard deviations from the mean, or more than three times theacceleration of gravity, and so large as not to be consistent with gustmitigation or avoidance. These extreme events occurred in short bursts thatmimic movement with turbulent vortices. The burst statistics and theirsymmetries approach those of turbulence toward longer timescales. On theshortest timescales, the bursts break the symmetry of small-scale turbulence infavor of upward accelerations that are more intermittent than turbulence. Weintroduce a simple nonlinear model that predicts the scale at which symmetrybreaks and the stronger intermittency on the smaller scales. These findingssuggest a ratcheting mechanism on turbulent gusts and constitute the firstquantitative evidence in favor of turbulent gust harvesting by wildlife. Animplication is that turbulence is so strong and pervasive as to make unsteadyand nonlinear aerodynamics an intrinsic and beneficial aspect of both flappingand soaring flight in the atmospheric boundary layer - one that we need toincorporate in our understanding of the energetics of flight.",11/29/2024,"['eagles', 'flight', 'soaring', 'soaringgolden', 'flappingand']"

Brownian spin-locking effect,"Abstract: Brownian systems are characterized by spatiotemporal disorder, which arisesfrom the erratic motion of particles driven by thermal fluctuations. When lightinteracts with such systems, it typically produces unpolarized and uncorrelatedfields. Here, we report the observation of a large-scale spin-locking effect oflight within a Brownian medium. In an observation direction perpendicular tothe incident wave momentum, scattering naturally divides into two diffusionregions, each associated with an opposite spin from the Brownian nanoparticles.This effect arises from the intrinsic spin-orbit interactions of scatteringfrom individual nanoparticles, which ubiquitously generate radiative spinfields that propagate through the Brownian medium with multiple incoherentscattering. It offers a novel experimental platform for exploring macroscalespin behaviors of diffused light, with potential applications in precisionmetrology for measuring various nanoparticle properties.

Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from  Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates arange of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largelyto indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have beendeveloped to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry,but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamicparameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employatomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selectedskin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We findthese simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up tomicrosecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced samplingtechniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-livedtemporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for theslow convergence of the free energy computations. Even after tremendoussimulation efforts, substantial errors in the free energy profiles remain,which we propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent ofthe enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of theprecise membrane model.",11/30/2024,"['thermodynamicparameters', 'samplingtechniques', 'chemistry', 'lipid', 'indoor']"

Singlet fission contributes to solar energy harvesting in photosynthesis,"Abstract: Singlet fission (SF), the spin-allowed conversion of one singlet exciton intotwo triplet excitons, offers a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiencyof photovoltaic devices. However, realising this potential necessitatesmaterials capable of ultrafast (sub-picosecond) SF and the generation oflong-lived (> microsecond) triplet excitons, a synthetic challenge. Somephotosynthetic organisms have evolved sophisticated molecular architecturesthat demonstrate these criteria, but despite 40 years of study, the underlyingSF mechanisms and its functional significance in these organisms remainunclear. Here, we use a suite of ultrafast and magneto-optical spectroscopictechniques to understand the mechanism of SF within light-harvesting 1 (LH1)complexes from wild-type and genetically modified photosynthetic bacteria. Ourfindings reveal a SF process, termed ""heterofission"", wherein singlet excitonsare transformed into triplet excitons localised on adjacent carotenoid (Crt)and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. We also uncover an unexpectedfunctional role for SF in augmenting Crt-to-BChl photosynthetic energy transferefficiency. By transiently storing electronic excitation within theSF-generated triplet pair, the system circumvents rapid thermalisation of Crtexcitations, thereby enhancing energy transfer efficiency to the BChl Qy state,and enabling the organism to usefully harvest more sunlight.",11/27/2024,"['spectroscopictechniques', 'photovoltaic', 'triplet', 'fission', 'ultrafast']"
The 2024 Motile Active Matter Roadmap,"Abstract: Activity and autonomous motion are fundamental aspects of many living andengineering systems. Here, the scale of biological agents covers a wide range,from nanomotors, cytoskeleton, and cells, to insects, fish, birds, and people.Inspired by biological active systems, various types of autonomous syntheticnano- and micromachines have been designed, which provide the basis formultifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent active materials. A majorchallenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherentnon-equilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidatesequilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversalsymmetry. Furthermore, interactions in ensembles of active agents are oftennon-additive and non-reciprocal. An important aspect of biological agents istheir ability to sense the environment, process this information, and adjusttheir motion accordingly. It is an important goal for the engineering ofmicro-robotic systems to achieve similar functionality. With many fundamentalproperties of motile active matter now reasonably well understood and undercontrol, the ground is prepared for the study of physical aspects andmechanisms of motion in complex environments, of the behavior of systems withnew physical features like chirality, of the development of novel micromachinesand microbots, of the emergent collective behavior and swarming of intelligentself-propelled particles, and of particular features of microbial systems.

The role of inhibitory neuronal variability in modulating phase  diversity between coupled networks,"Abstract: Neuronal heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of a multitude ofspiking neuronal patterns, is a widespread phenomenon throughout the nervoussystem. In particular, the brain exhibits strong variability among inhibitoryneurons. Despite the huge neuronal heterogeneity across brain regions, which inprinciple could decrease synchronization, cortical areas coherently oscillateduring various cognitive tasks. Therefore, the functional significance ofneuronal heterogeneity remains a subject of active investigation. Previousstudies typically focus on the role of heterogeneity in the dynamic propertiesof only one population. Here, we explore how different types of inhibitoryneurons can contribute to the diversity of the phase relations between twocortical areas. This research sheds light on the potential impact of localproperties, such as neuronal variability, on communication between distantbrain regions. We show that both homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitorynetworks can exhibit phase diversity and nonintuitive regimes such asanticipated synchronization (AS) and phase bistability. It has been proposedthat the bi-stable phase could be related to bi-stable perception, such as inthe Necker cube. Moreover, we show that heterogeneity enlarges the region ofzero-lag synchronization and bistability. We also show that the parametercontrolling inhibitory heterogeneity modulates the transition from the usualdelayed synchronization regime (DS) to AS. Finally, we show that the inhibitoryheterogeneity drives the internal dynamics of the free-running population.Therefore, we suggest a possible mechanism to explain when the DS-AS transitionoccurs via zero-lag synchronization or bi-stability.",11/29/2024,"['inhibitoryheterogeneity', 'nervoussystem', 'neuronal', 'inhibitoryneurons', 'ofneuronal']"
Unveiling the Role of Lewis Base Strength in Small-Molecule Passivation  of Defect Perovskites,"Abstract: Perovskite materials are highly promising for a range of optoelectronicapplications including energy conversion technologies, owing to their highcharge-carrier mobilities, adaptability of bandgap tuning, and exceptionallight-harvesting capabilities. Yet, defects that arise during manufacturingoften lead to performance limitations such as hindered efficiency andstability. This is primarily due to significant deviations in crystal geometryand band structure elements such as the Fermi level, work function, and densityof states, compared to pristine perovskite. To mitigate these issues, thisstudy explored the passivation of surface iodide-vacancy defect in perovskiteusing small-molecule Lewis bases, an approach aims to counteract thesedetrimental effects. Among the examined N-, P- and O-coordinated benzylderivatives, those featuring a phosphonic acid group as a passivator for theundercoordinated Pb(II) sites demonstrated outstanding electronic structureproperties. This was notably achieved by lowering the Fermi level, increasingthe work function, and suppressing surface trap states.

Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS) Coupled with  an Interferometer for On-Band and Off-Band Detection of Glyoxal,"Abstract: Glyoxal CHOCHO is a trace gas in the atmosphere, often used as an indicatorof biogenic emissions. It is frequently compared to formaldehydeconcentrations, which serve as indicators of anthropogenic emissions, to gaininsights into the characteristics of the environmental source. This studyemployed broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to detect gaseousCHOCHO, methylglyoxal, and $\mathrm{NO_2}$. Two different detection methods arecompared. Spectrograph and CCD Detection: This approach involves coupling thesystem to a spectrograph with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Itachieved a 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit of $2.5 \times 10^8$molecules/cm$^3$, or 10 parts per trillion (ppt). Methylglyoxal and$\mathrm{NO_2}$ achieved 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limits of 34 ppt and 22ppt, respectively. Interferometer and PMT Detection: In this method, aninterferometer is used in conjunction with a photomultiplier tube (PMT)detector.

PDMD: Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics for Variable-sized  Water Clusters,"Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches, such as ab initioMD and empirical force field MD, face significant trade-offs between physicalaccuracy and computational efficiency. This work presents a novelPotential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics (PDMD) framework for predictingsystem energy and atomic forces of variable-sized water clusters. Specifically,PDMD employs the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to generatehigh-dimensional, equivariant features before leveraging ChemGNN, a graphneural network model that adaptively learns the atomic chemical environmentswithout requiring a priori knowledge. Through an iterative self-consistenttraining approach, the converged PDMD achieves a mean absolute error of 7.1meV/atom for energy and 59.8 meV/angstrom for forces, outperforming thestate-of-the-art DeepMD by ~80% in energy accuracy and ~200% in forceprediction. As a result, PDMD can reproduce the ab initio MD properties ofwater clusters at a tiny fraction of its computational cost. These resultsdemonstrate that the proposed PDMD offers multiple-phase predictive power,enabling ultra-fast, general-purpose MD simulations while retaining ab initioaccuracy.",12/5/2024,"['resultsdemonstrate', 'predictingsystem', 'molecular', 'graphneural', 'computational']"
Utilizing redundancies in Qubit Hilbert Space to reduce entangling gate  counts in the Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster Method,"Abstract: We present a new method for state preparation using the Unitary VibrationalCoupled-Cluster (UVCC) technique. Our approach utilizes redundancies in theHilbert space in the direct mapping of vibrational modes into qubits. Byeliminating half of the qubit controls required in the Trotterized UVCC ansatz,our method achieves up to a 50% theoretical reduction in the entangling gatecount compared to other methods and up to a 28% reduction compared practicallyuseful approaches. This improvement enhances the fidelity of UVCC statepreparation, enabling more efficient and earlier implementation of complexquantum vibrational structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. Weexperimentally demonstrate our method on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum hardware,achieving significantly higher fidelities for 6- and 8-qubit systems comparedto existing implementations. For fault-tolerant architectures, eliminating halfof the control qubits in multi-controlled rotations incurs an additionalToffoli gate overhead elsewhere in the circuit. Thus, the overall performancegain depends on the specific decomposition method used for multi-controlledgates.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'vibrationalcoupled', 'redundancies', 'new', 'additionaltoffoli']"
Quantum circuit and mapping algorithms for wavepacket dynamics: case  study of anharmonic hydrogen bonds in protonated and hydroxide water clusters,"Abstract: The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is consideredto be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasingdimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with othermethods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nucleardynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct mapbetween the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepackettime-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian thatdescribes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. Thismap is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spinstates emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomesapproximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present ageneral quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using amethod called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robustand is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuitcomplexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator(QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be ingood agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrationalfrequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are inagreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.",12/4/2024,"['nucleardynamics', 'quantum', 'algorithms', 'nuclear', 'circuitcomplexity']"
Water under hydrophobic confinement: entropy and diffusion,"Abstract: The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confinedgeometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusionof water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobicconfining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamicssimulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion neara non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate ahydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in thewater layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observeddiffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using theuniversal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusionrate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that hasso far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids,can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the lawcan be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinementwhich is currently a subject of intense research activity.",12/4/2024,"['hydrophobicconfining', 'dynamicssimulation', 'enhanced', 'thewater', 'intense']"
The entropic origin of the enhancement of liquid diffusion at the  confining wall,Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics simulation investigating the dynamics of asimple liquid in the proximity to a non-interacting smooth confining wall. Astrong enhancement of the liquid diffusion is observed within the layersadjacent to the wall. We present an analysis of these results in terms of thescaling law earlier reported by one of us that relates the liquid diffusionrate to the excess entropy. It is demonstrated that this scaling law cansuccessfully account for the observed diffusion enhancement in the liquid nearto the confining wall. We show that the proximity of a confining wall resultsin the decrease of (the absolute value of) the local excess entropy in theliquid layers closest to the wall which induces the observed diffusionenhancement in these layers. These results thereby show that the applicationscope of the scaling law which has so far only been used for the description ofthe bulk liquid diffusion can be extended to the diffusion in liquids undernano-scale confinement.,11/1/2023,"['diffusionenhancement', 'diffusionrate', 'liquids', 'applicationscope', 'layersadjacent']"
Nonlinear Optimal Control of Electron Dynamics within Hartree-Fock  Theory,"Abstract: Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field todrive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For evenmoderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exactequations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) -- isnumerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem withintime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of theTDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effortwhile maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. Weframe this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHFequations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computedvia a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we showthat with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our methodyields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints andtolerances.",12/4/2024,"['optimization', 'approximation', 'methodyields', 'solving', 'molecular']"
"PLUMED Tutorials: a collaborative, community-driven learning ecosystem","Abstract: In computational physics, chemistry, and biology, the implementation of newtechniques in a shared and open source software lowers barriers to entry andpromotes rapid scientific progress.

Wavepacket and Reduced-Density Approaches for High-Dimensional Quantum  Dynamics: Application to the Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Asymmetrical  Light-Harvesting Building Blocks,"Abstract: Excitation-energy transfer (EET) and relaxation in an optically excitedbuilding block of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) dendrimers are simulatedusing wavepackets with the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree(ML-MCTDH) method and reduced-density matrices with the hierachical equationsof motion (HEOM) approach. The dynamics of the ultrafast electronic funnelingbetween the first two excited electronic states in the asymmetricallymeta-substituted PPE oligomer with two rings on one branch and three rings onthe other side, with a shared ring in between, is treated with 93-dimensionalab initio vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian (VCH) models, either linear or withbilinear and quadratic terms. The linear VCH model is also used to model anopen quantum system. The linear-response absorption and emission spectra aresimulated with both the ML-MCTDH and HEOM methods.

Fast and flexible range-separated models for atomistic machine learning,"Abstract: Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz, anddecompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions.This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that aredominated by long-range physical effects - most notably electrostatics. Manyapproaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts tomake them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need toincorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-rangeinteractions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the establishedalgorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions - including Ewald summation,classical particle-mesh Ewald (PME), and particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M)Ewald - into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for PyTorch aswell as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-rangepotentials, we introduce purified descriptors which disregard the immediateneighborhood of each atom, and are more suitable for general long-ranged MLapplications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: Theyprovide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be usedin the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit theavailability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-rangemodels with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexibleto implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions asbuilding blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pmelibraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, to train range-separatedML potentials, and to evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomicstructures.",12/4/2024,"['manyapproaches', 'atomicstructures', 'atomistic', 'simulations', 'complex']"
Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules  under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces,"Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavitysystems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics.

The approach employs an efficientnumerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in realspace-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecularmapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble ofmolecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavitiesand at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations revealdramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to freespace, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising fromcavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of apreviously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing ofthe collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates thatstrong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectraof chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controllinglight-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.",12/3/2024,"['molecularmapping', 'quantum', 'electromagneticinteractions', 'cavitysystems', 'efficientnumerical']"
Quantifying the Critical Micelle Concentration of Nonionic and Ionic  Surfactants by Self-Consistent Field Theory,"Abstract: Quantifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and understanding itsrelationship with both the intrinsic molecular structures and environmentalconditions are crucial for the rational design of surfactants. Here, we developa self-consistent field theory which unifies the study of CMC, micellarstructure and kinetic pathway of micellization in one framework. The long-rangeelectrostatic interactions are accurately treated, which not only makes thetheory applicable to both nonionic and ionic surfactants but also enables us tocapture a variety of salt effects. The effectiveness and versatility of thetheory is verified by applying it to three types of commonly used surfactants.For polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (C$_m$E$_n$) surfactants, we predict a widespan of CMC from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$M as the composition parameters $m$ and$n$ are adjusted. For the ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant, weshow the decrease of CMC as salt concentration increases, and capture both thespecific cation effect and the specific anion effect. Furthermore, for sodiumlauryl ether sulfate (SLES) surfactants, we find a non-monotonic dependence ofboth the CMC and micelle size on the number of oxyethylene groups. Ourtheoretical predictions of CMC are in quantitative agreement with experimentaldata reported in literature for all the three types of surfactants.",12/4/2024,"['versatility', 'surfactants', 'surfactant', 'itsrelationship', 'experimentaldata']"
Consequences of the failure of equipartition for the p-V behavior of  liquid water and the hydration free energy components of a small protein,"Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid modelof water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fsto ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here weextend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueousprotein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the proteinBBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integrationtime-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plusbarostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensureconsistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioningalleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-stepused with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations,and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are alsoseen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the$NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contributionto the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. Thesecontributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fsto $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waalscontribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding freeenergy reported for this protein.",12/4/2024,"['molecular', 'aqueousprotein', 'proteinbba', 'integrationtime', 'protein']"

String-like Rearrangements Induce Mobility in Supercooled Liquids,"Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity is a signature phenomenon of deeply supercooledliquids and glasses.

We find that mobility is propagated through theentrainment of particles into elementary string-like rearrangements, known asmicrostrings, and not through perturbing the structure surrounding theserearrangements.",12/4/2024,"['supercooledliquids', 'fordynamical', 'dynamical', 'correlationsbetween', 'localrelaxation']"
Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of  Metal-Organic Frameworks,"Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materialsstudied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and waterharvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermalexpansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large numberof atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT)methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machinelearning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0,that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phononproperties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phononsin MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model,MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representativeand diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonondensity of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0,enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision.The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreementwith DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs.

Pooling Solvent Mixtures for Solvation Free Energy Predictions,"Abstract: Solvation free energy is an important design parameter in reaction kineticsand separation processes, making it a critical property to predict duringprocess development. In previous research, directed message passing neuralnetworks (D-MPNN) have successfully been used to predict solvation freeenergies and enthalpies in organic solvents. However, solvent mixtures providegreater flexibility for optimizing solvent interactions than monosolvents. Thiswork aims to extend our previous models to mixtures. To handle mixtures in apermutation invariant manner we propose a pooling function; MolPool. With thispooling function, the machine learning models can learn and predict propertiesfor an arbitrary number of molecules. The novel SolProp-mix software thatapplies MolPool to D-MPNN was compared to state-of-the-art architectures forpredicting mixture properties and validated with our new database of COSMOthermcalculations; BinarySolv-QM. To improve predictions towards experimentalaccuracy, the network was then fine-tuned on experimental data in monosolvents.To demonstrate the benefit of this transfer learning methodology, experimentaldatasets of solvation free energies in binary (BinarySolv-Exp) and ternary(TernarySolv-Exp) solvent mixtures were compiled from data on vapor-liquidequilibria and activity coefficients. The neural network performed better thanCOSMOtherm calculations with an MAE of 0.25 kcal/mol and an RMSE of 0.37kcal/mol for non-aqueous mixed solvents. Additionally, the ability to capturetrends for a varying mixture composition was validated successfully. Ourmodel's ability to accurately predict mixture properties from the combinationof in silico data and pure component experimental data is promising given thescarcity of experimental data for mixtures in many fields.",12/2/2024,"['experimentalaccuracy', 'experimentaldatasets', 'cosmothermcalculations', 'ourmodel', 'neuralnetworks']"
Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse  resolution,"Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central tonon-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns outto be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversalsymmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations.Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probelow-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known tointroduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become ""lumped""onto the same observable ""state"" or when introducing ""reaction coordinates"" toreduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversalsymmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In thisperspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry,and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on themicroscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not atechnical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that aredrawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in thefield and reflect upon key challenges.",12/3/2024,"['physics', 'reversalsymmetry', 'themicroscopic', 'challenging', 'complex']"
Hamiltonian-based neural networks for systems under nonholonomic  constraints,"Abstract: There has been increasing interest in methodologies that incorporate physicspriors into neural network architectures to enhance their modelingcapabilities. A family of these methodologies that has gained traction areHamiltonian neural networks (HNN) and their variations. These architecturesexplicitly encode Hamiltonian mechanics both in their structure and lossfunction. Although Hamiltonian systems under nonholonomic constraints are ingeneral not Hamiltonian, it is possible to formulate them in pseudo-Hamiltonianform, equipped with a Lie bracket which is almost Poisson. This opens thepossibility of using some principles of HNNs in systems under nonholonomicconstraints. The goal of the present work is to develop a modified Hamiltonianneural network architecture capable of modeling Hamiltonian systems underholonomic and nonholonomic constraints. A three-network parallel architectureis proposed to simultaneously learn the Hamiltonian of the system, theconstraints, and their associated multipliers. A rolling disk and a ball on aspinning table are considered as canonical examples to assess the performanceof the proposed Hamiltonian architecture. The experiments are then repeatedwith a noisy training set to study modeling performance under more realisticconditions.",12/4/2024,"['physicspriors', 'modelingcapabilities', 'architecturesexplicitly', 'neural', 'hamiltonian']"
Alternative sum rules and waterbed effects of Lorentz resonator system  for sound absorption and transmission in a unidimensional waveguide,"Abstract: We investigate fundamental constraints on passive linear time-invariantacoustic systems through the developing alternative linear sum rules for soundabsorption and transmission. Our approach, based on the Herglotz functionmethod, yields integral identities without non-linear logarithmic terms orfrequency weightings, providing clearer physical insights into systemperformance limits. The study focuses on unidimensional waveguides with Lorentzresonators, encompassing various practical acoustic structures. The developedsum rules are found to be particularly effective in predicting constraints onthe average sound absorption coefficient for broadband absorbers operating indeep-subwavelength structures. Based on these rules, we demonstrate thewaterbed effect in such systems, highlighting the inherent compromises betweenabsorption efficiency, bandwidth, and device thickness. Through case studies ofresonator arrays and membranes, we illustrate the practical implications ofthese new sum rules for designing optimal sound absorbers and isolators.

Floquet scattering of shallow water waves by a vertically oscillating  plate,"Abstract: We report on the scattering of a plane wave from a vertically oscillatingplate in the low frequency approximation by means of Floquet theory. In thecase of a static plate, the scattering coefficients are evaluated via modematching method for the full two-dimensional linearised water wave problem andare compared with the coefficients obtained from a reduced one-dimensionalmodel in the shallow water approximation. The main part of the analysis is theextension of this 1D shallow water approximation to the case of a verticallyoscillating plate, where time modulation is only encapsulated in the blockagecoefficient. We show that the incident wave is scattered into Floquet sidebandsand extract the scattering coefficients for each harmonic using a Floquetscattering formalism.

Spontaneous rolling on a 90 degree incline,"Abstract: On perfectly vertical surfaces, rolling is conventionally deemed impossiblewithout external torque. While various species like geckos and spiders exhibitvertical locomotion, they cannot achieve rolling; instead, they fall. In thisstudy, we demonstrate the spontaneous rolling of an elastic polyacrylamidesphere on an elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate held vertically at a90 degree incline, given specific elasticity values for the materials. Ourexperiments uncover a slow rolling motion induced by a dynamically changingcontact diameter and a unique contact asymmetry. The advancing edge behaveslike a closing crack, while the receding edge acts as an opening crack.Utilizing adhesion hysteresis theories and crack propagation models, we explainhow this contact asymmetry generates the necessary torque and friction tomaintain rolling, preventing either pinning or falling. The findings challengethe traditional understanding of vertical surface interactions and open newavenues for exploring soft-on-soft contact systems. This novel phenomenon haspotential implications for designing advanced materials and understandingbiological locomotion on vertical surfaces.",11/28/2024,"['spiders', 'impossiblewithout', 'geckos', 'asymmetry', 'friction']"
A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to  universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos,"Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harboruniversal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics ofhierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistentmystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory(QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven,inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governingVlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) forthe secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due tolinear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) thatare collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by theresponse matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up toall orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in$N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core,and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractorsolutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-statesolution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale whitenoise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universalnature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract moreparticles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by thefluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolatedhalo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ caneither be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundarycondition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compactsubhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these haloprofiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxationdescribed by a self-consistent QLT.",11/28/2024,"['physics', 'equations', 'collisionless', 'relaxationdescribed', 'inhomogeneous']"

In the current work, we present a fundamental theory for thethermodynamics and the kinetics for mass transport and electromagnetic wavepropagation in non-uniform system when an interface is present. We willdemonstrate that Maxwell-Ampere equation, Lorenz force, and Gauss' law formagnetic field all have to be modified at the phase interface.

Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on  $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space,"Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory usingfractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageablesymmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arisein the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3\times \mathbb{R}^1$ space.

Curvature effects on the regimes of the lateral van der Waals force,"Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that, under the action of the lateral van derWaals (vdW) force due to a perfectly conducting corrugated plane, a neutralanisotropic polarizable particle in vacuum can be attracted not only to thenearest corrugation peak but also to a valley or an intermediate point betweena peak and a valley, with such behaviors called the peak, valley, andintermediate regimes, respectively.

Rate-Dependent Tensile Response of Polyvinyl Chloride Geomembranes,"Abstract: One of the challenge that face the effectiveness of Polyvinyl Chloridegeomembranes (PVC GMs) as a hydraulic barrier is the capacity to withstandunexpected mechanical actions, particularly tensile forces, during installationand throughout their lifespan. These forces pose risks of premature failure andimpermeability degradation. In this study, the characterization of the shortand long-term mechanical response of PVC GMs to uniaxial tensile forces hasbeen investigated. Uniaxial tensile test have been performed for tensile ratesspanning several orders of magnitude. Analysis of the true stress-strain curvesreveals a significant decrease in tensile modulus, strength, and strain atfailure at low strain rates, which are relatively close to those applied insitu. Long-term investigations have been conducted as well, through relaxationtests. Our key results unveil two distinct characteristic times in stressrelaxation, with the fast relaxation occurring over the first four hours.During this phase, the pre-relaxation loading rate affects the relaxationbehavior. Beyond this phase, the relaxation behavior becomes independent fromthe pre-relaxation loading rate. Burger's rheological model is proposed tomeasure the stress relaxation at different rates. The model's results validatethe existence of two characteristic times.",11/25/2024,"['rheological', 'hydraulic', 'chloridegeomembranes', 'stressrelaxation', 'withstandunexpected']"
A Data-Driven Framework for Discovering Fractional Differential  Equations in Complex Systems,"Abstract: In complex physical systems, conventional differential equations often fallshort in capturing non-local and memory effects, as they are limited to localdynamics and integer-order interactions. This study introduces a stepwisedata-driven framework for discovering fractional differential equations (FDEs)directly from data. FDEs, known for their capacity to model non-local dynamicswith fewer parameters than integer-order derivatives, can represent complexsystems with long-range interactions. Our framework applies deep neuralnetworks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisyobservations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challengesposed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparsecoefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimizationapproach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques.We validate the framework across various datasets, including syntheticanomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozensoils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\'{e}vy motion. Resultsdemonstrate the framework's robustness in identifying the structure of FDEsacross diverse noise levels and its capacity to capture integer-order dynamics,offering a flexible approach for modeling memory effects in complex systems.",12/5/2024,"['neuralnetworks', 'syntheticanomalous', 'equations', 'localdynamics', 'resultsdemonstrate']"

Two-dimensional \b{eta}-phase copper iodide: a promising candidate for  low-temperature thermoelectric applications,"Abstract: Bismuth telluride-based materials is the only commercially viableroom-temperature thermoelectric material, despite its limited tellurium andpoor mechanical properties. The search for materials with a high figure ofmerit (zT > 1.00) near room temperature remains a major challenge. In thiswork, we systematically investigate the structural stability and thethermoelectric capabilities of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and {\gamma}-CuI throughthe density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory.Based on the thermoelectric transport coefficients of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and{\gamma}-CuI, we predict their zT values will vary with carrier concentrationand increase with temperature. Comparing the zT values, monolayer \b{eta}-CuIdemonstrates superior thermoelectric properties compared to {\gamma}-CuI. Atroom temperature, the optimal zT values of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI exceed 1.50,with particularly high values of 2.98 (p-type) and 4.10 (n-type) along theZigzag direction, demonstrating significant anisotropy. These results suggestthe great potential of the monolayer \b{eta}-CuI is promising candidatematerials for low temperature thermoelectric applications.",12/5/2024,"['thermoelectric', 'thethermoelectric', 'candidatematerials', 'challenge', 'anisotropy']"
Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice with an Indefinite Long-Range  Interaction,"Abstract: Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactionsin lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interactionmatrices. We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive-and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageablesign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on largelattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interactionmatrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition withinthe Gross-Neveu criticality class. Notably, the phase transition boundaryaligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing newevidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship betweenphase transitions and the sign problem.",12/5/2024,"['fermions', 'quantum', 'honeycomb', 'largelattices', 'simulations']"

A Graph Neural Network Approach to Dispersed Systems,"Abstract: We present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that accurately simulates amultidisperse suspension of interacting spherical particles.

Nodes and edges ofthe GNN correspond to, respectively, the particles with their individualproperties/data (e.g., radius, position, velocity) and the pair interactionsbetween the particles (e.g., electrostatics, hydrodynamics). A key contributionof our work is to account for the finite dimensions of the particles and theirimpact on the system dynamics. We test our GNN against an exemplary case studyof a multidisperse mixture of two-dimensional spheres sedimenting under gravityin a liquid and interacting with each other by a Lennard-Jones potential.

Dielectric tensor of perovskite oxides at finite temperature using  equivariant graph neural network potentials,"Abstract: Atomistic simulations of properties of materials at finite temperatures arecomputationally demanding and require models that are more efficient than theab initio approaches.

Here, we demonstrate the utility of ML models in capturing propertiesof realistic materials by performing finite temperature molecular dynamicssimulations of perovskite oxides using a force field based on equivariant graphneural networks.

A Novel and Simple Invariant-Domain-Preserving Framework for PAMPA  Scheme: 1D Case,"Abstract: The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in[R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combinesconservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation lawsto evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservationlaws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions staywithin this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novelframework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPAschemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in theoriginal PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition andmidpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlightsthe difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariantdomain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cellmidpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees thepreservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages withoutrequiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existingbound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limitingto blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by theSoftplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose anautomatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in anunconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We alsointroduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme tocapture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems,including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressibleEuler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness ofthe proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.",12/4/2024,"['polynomial', 'novelframework', 'cellmidpoint', 'math', 'pampaschemes']"
Joint Approximate Diagonalization approach to Quasiparticle  Self-Consistent $GW$ calculations,"Abstract: We introduce an alternative route to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$calculations ($\mathrm{qs}GW$) on the basis of a Joint ApproximateDiagonalization of the one-body $GW$ Green's functions $G(\varepsilon_n^{QP})$taken at the input quasiparticle energies. Such an approach allows working withthe full dynamical self-energy, without approximating the latter by asymmetrized static form as in the standard $\mathrm{qs}GW$ scheme. Calculationson the $GW$100 molecular test set lead nevertheless to a good agreement, at the65 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respectto the conventional $\mathrm{qs}GW$ approach. We show further that constructingthe density matrix from the full Green's function as in the fullyself-consistent $\mathrm{sc}GW$ scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticleone-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between$\mathrm{qs}GW$ and $\mathrm{sc}GW$ approaches, closer to CCSD(T) referencevalues.",12/4/2024,"['approximatediagonalization', 'calculations', 'mathrm', 'calculationson', 'varepsilon_n']"

Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Tensor Network Representation,"Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful tool for sampling from complexprobability distributions. Despite its versatility, MCMC often suffers fromstrong autocorrelation and the negative sign problem, leading to slowing downthe convergence of statistical error. We propose a novel MCMC formulation basedon tensor network representations to reduce the population variance andmitigate these issues systematically. By introducing stochastic projectors intothe tensor network framework and employing Markov chain sampling, our methodeliminates the systematic error associated with low-rank approximation intensor contraction while maintaining the high accuracy of the tensor networkmethod. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on thetwo-dimensional Ising model, achieving an exponential reduction in statisticalerror with increasing bond dimension cutoff. Furthermore, we address the signproblem in systems with negative weights, showing significant improvements inaverage signs as bond dimension cutoff increases. The proposed frameworkprovides a robust solution for accurate statistical estimation in complexsystems, paving the way for broader applications in computational physics andbeyond.",12/4/2024,"['complexprobability', 'markov', 'statisticalerror', 'versatility', 'autocorrelation']"
Fast and stable tight-binding framework for nonlocal kinetic energy  density functional reconstruction in orbital-free density functional  calculations,"Abstract: Nonlocal kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) with density-dependentkernels are currently the most accurate functionals available for orbital-freedensity functional theory (OF-DFT) calculations. However, despite advances innumerical techniques and using only (semi)local density-dependent kernels,nonlocal KEDFs still present substantial computational costs in OF-DFT,limiting their application in large-scale material simulations. To address thischallenge, we propose an efficient framework for reconstructing nonlocal KEDFsby incorporating the density functional tight-binding approach, in which theenergy functionals are simplified through a first-order functional expansionbased on the superposition of free-atom electron densities. This strategyallows the computationally expensive nonlocal kinetic energy and potentialcalculations to be performed only once during the electron density optimizationprocess, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining highaccuracy. Benchmark tests using advanced nonlocal KEDFs, such as revHC andLDAK-MGPA, on standard structures including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Si, III-Vsemiconductors, as well as Mg$_{50}$ and Si$_{50}$ clusters, demonstrate thatour method achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, providing acost-effective balance between accuracy and computational speed. Additionally,the reconstructed functionals exhibit improved numerical stability for bothbulk and finite systems, paving the way for developing more sophisticated KEDFsfor realistic material simulations using OF-DFT.",12/4/2024,"['expensive', 'efficient', 'computationally', 'tight', 'sophisticated']"

Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films,"Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy onMgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Paulingcurve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$$\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average totalmoment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to thehistorical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculationsreveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase onMgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bctCo$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic momentsthan those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001),BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the averageatomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increasedstructural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMReffects and better MTJ devices.",12/3/2024,"['molecular', 'ferromagnetic', 'atomic', 'calculationsreveal', 'magnetic']"
Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo,"Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significantchallenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application duringthe decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle theproblems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as theratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{\hat{O}}\rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{\hat{O}e^{-\beta H}})$and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions canbe estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then beconnected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully appliedthis scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2Dsystems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorderoperators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweightingpath is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and(imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture thecomplex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, whichprovides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.",12/2/2024,"['decades', 'disorderoperators', 'reweightingpath', 'quantum', 'carlo']"
Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories,"Abstract: A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of anetwork whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as atrajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics ofsuch trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, itis sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensionalEuclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure ofeach network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to bepreserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots.This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches thatexplicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to performPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensiblemethodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite ofgenerative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivialdynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in theirscalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time seriesanalysis in temporal networks.",11/29/2024,"['comprehensiblemethodology', 'graph', 'performprincipal', 'snapshots', 'dimensionaleuclidean']"

"The ecological forecast horizon revisited: Potential, actual and  relative system predictability","Abstract: Ecological forecasts are model-based statements about currently unknownecosystem states in time or space. For a model forecast to be useful to informdecision-makers, model validation and verification determine adequateness. Themeasure of forecast goodness that can be translated into a limit up to which aforecast is acceptable is known as the `forecast horizon'. While verificationof meteorological models follows strict criteria with established metrics andforecast horizons, assessments of ecological forecasting models still remainexperiment-specific and forecast horizons are rarely reported. As such, usersof ecological forecasts remain uninformed of how far into the future statementscan be trusted. In this work, we synthesise existing approaches, defineempirical forecast horizons in a unified framework for assessing ecologicalpredictability and offer recipes on their computation. We distinguish upper andlower boundary estimates of predictability limits, reflecting the model'spotential and actual forecast horizon, and show how a benchmark model can helpdetermine its relative forecast horizon.

We extracted 215 HRFs and 1024DRFs by PySERA and a 3D-Autoencoder, respectively, within the ViSERA software,from segmented primary tumors. The supervised strategy (SL) employed a HMLSs:PCA connected with 4 classifiers on both HRF and DRFs. SSL strategy expandedthe datasets by adding 408 pseudo-labeled HNCa cases (labeled by Random Forestalgorithm) to 199 LCa cases, using the same HMLSs techniques. Furthermore,Principal Component Analysis (PCA) linked with 4 survival prediction algorithmswere utilized in survival hazard ratio analysis. Results: SSL strategyoutperformed SL method (p-value<0.05), achieving an average accuracy of 0.85with DRFs from PET and PCA+ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), compared to 0.65 forSL strategy using DRFs from CT and PCA+ K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Additionally,PCA linked with Component-wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis on both HRFsand DRFs, as extracted from CT, had an average c-index of 0.80 with a Log Rankp-value<<0.001, confirmed by external testing.

In this study, we investigate the Wavelet ScatteringTransform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach.Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signaldeformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suitedfor the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGOO1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the useof more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore,we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform,demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capturecomplementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This workcontributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational waveanalysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signaldetection and classification.",11/28/2024,"['einstein', 'astrophysics', 'relativity', 'gravitational', 'theoretical']"
Methodology for Online Estimation of Rheological Parameters in Polymer  Melts Using Deep Learning and Microfluidics,"Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in biological and chemicalexperiments due to their cost-effectiveness for rheological estimation influids. However, these devices often face challenges in terms of accuracy,size, and cost. This study presents a methodology, integrating deep learning,modeling and simulation to enhance the design of microfluidic systems, used todevelop an innovative approach for viscosity measurement of polymer melts. Weuse synthetic data generated from the simulations to train a deep learningmodel, which then identifies rheological parameters of polymer melts frompressure drop and flow rate measurements in a microfluidic circuit, enablingonline estimation of fluid properties.

Global drag reduction and local flow statistics in Taylor-Couette  turbulence with dilute polymer additives,"Abstract: We present an experimental study on the drag reduction by polymers inTaylor-Couette turbulence at Reynolds numbers ($Re$) ranging from $4\times10^3$ to $2.5\times 10^4$. In this $Re$ regime, the Taylor vortex is presentand accounts for more than 50\% of the total angular velocity flux.Polyacrylamide polymers with two different average molecular weights are used.It is found that the drag reduction rate increases with polymer concentrationand approaches the maximum drag reduction (MDR) limit. At MDR, the frictionfactor follows the $-0.58$ scaling, i.e., $C_f \sim Re^{-0.58}$, similar tochannel/pipe flows. However, the drag reduction rate is about $20\%$ at MDR,which is much lower than that in channel/pipe flows at comparable $Re$. We alsofind that the Reynolds shear stress does not vanish and the slope of the meanazimuthal velocity profile in the logarithmic layer remains unchanged at MDR.These behaviours are reminiscent of the low drag reduction regime reported inchannel flow (Warholic et al., Exp. Fluids, vol. 27, issue 5, 1999, p.461-472). We reveal that the lower drag reduction rate originates from the factthat polymers strongly suppress the turbulent flow while only slightly weakenthe mean Taylor vortex. We further show that polymers steady the velocityboundary layer and suppress the small-scale G\""{o}rtler vortices in thenear-wall region. The former effect reduces the emission rate of both intensefast and slow plumes detached from the boundary layer, resulting in less fluxtransport from the inner cylinder to the outer one and reduces energy inputinto the bulk turbulent flow. Our results suggest that in turbulent flows,where secondary flow structures are statistically persistent and dominate theglobal transport properties of the system, the drag reduction efficiency ofpolymer additives is significantly diminished.",12/5/2024,"['polyacrylamide', 'times10', 'velocityboundary', 'polymers', 'warholic']"
Computing sessile droplet shapes on arbitrary surfaces with a new  pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics model,"Abstract: The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in thephysics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, fromagrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-worldapplications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complexsubstrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired.Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis ofwell-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problemis not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of thecontact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such aspairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used toconveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwiseforce model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in theliterature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair ofpolynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPHmodel in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities bycomputing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with ahydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughnessand variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended todynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.",12/5/2024,"['hydrodynamics', 'complexsubstrates', 'computational', 'bycomputing', 'microfluidic']"
Wall Slip Effects on Parameter Estimation for Integral-Type Viscoelastic  Models: Insights from High Density Polyethylene and Thermoplastic Elastomer  Melts,"Abstract: This study explores the impact of wall slip on parameter estimation forintegral-type non-linear viscoelastic models with time-strain separable memoryfunctions, specifically examining high-density polyethylene (HDPE) andthermoplastic elastomer (TPE) melts. Significant wall slip was observed in HDPEunder non-linear conditions, complicating the characterization of its dampingfunction using step strain data. In contrast, TPE exhibited negligible wallslip across a wide range of strains and shear rates, facilitating successfulparameterization of its damping function using the Wagner-type K-BKZ equationand enabling accurate predictions of various material functions. For HDPE, thestudy investigated alternative approaches to parameterize the K-BKZ equation,including the use of steady and time-dependent material functions at lowdeformation rates where wall slip effects are minimal. The findings underscorethe challenges of estimating parameters in the presence of wall slip andpropose strategies to address these challenges, particularly for materials likeHDPE, where pronounced slip complicates traditional rheologicalcharacterization.",12/4/2024,"['dampingfunction', 'rheologicalcharacterization', 'successfulparameterization', 'damping', 'memoryfunctions']"
Restricted Euler dynamics in free-surface turbulence,"Abstract: The small-scale velocity gradient is connected to fundamental properties ofturbulence at the large scales. By neglecting the viscous and nonlocal pressureHessian terms, we derive a restricted Euler model for the turbulent flow alongan undeformed free surface and discuss the associated stable/unstablemanifolds. The model is compared with the data collected by high-resolutionimaging on the free surface of a turbulent water tank with negligible surfacewaves. The joint probability density function (PDF) of the velocity gradientinvariants exhibits a distinct pattern from the one in the bulk. The restrictedEuler model captures the enhanced probability along the unstable branch of themanifold and the asymmetry of the joint PDF. Significant deviations between theexperiments and the prediction are evident, however, in particular concerningthe compressibility of the surface flow. These results highlight the enhancedintermittency of the velocity gradient and the influence of the free surface onthe energy cascade.",12/4/2024,"['gradientinvariants', 'unstablemanifolds', 'pressurehessian', 'pdf', 'tank']"
Scaling laws for concentration-gradient-driven electrolyte transport  through a 2D membrane,"Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials exhibit unique properties that arepromising for diverse applications, including those relevant toconcentration-gradient-driven transport of electrolyte solutions through porousmembranes made from these materials, such as water desalination, osmotic power,and iontronics. Here we derive general equations, and determine scaling laws inthe thick and thin electric-double-layer limits, that quantify the variation ofthe concentration-gradient-driven flow rate, solute flux and electric currentwith the pore radius, surface charge density and Debye screening length for thetransport of a dilute electrolyte solution through a circular aperture in aninfinitesimally thin planar membrane. We also determine scaling laws for theelectric-field-driven flow rate in the thin electric-double-layer limit in thesame geometry. We show that these scaling laws accurately capture the scalingrelationships from finite-element numerical simulations within theDebye-H\""uckel regime, and extend the theory to obtain scaling laws in the thinelectric-double-layer limit that hold even when the electric potential energyis large compared with the thermal energy. These scaling laws indicate unusualbehavior for concentration-gradient-driven flow in a 2D membrane that is notseen in thicker membranes, which has broad implications for liquid transportthrough membranes whose thickness comparable to, or smaller than, their poresize.",12/5/2024,"['nanomaterials', 'iontronics', 'porousmembranes', 'electrolyte', 'poresize']"
MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics,"Abstract: Multiphase gas, with hot ($\sim10^6$K) and cold ($\sim10^4$K) gas, isubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However,simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the largeseparation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which suchgas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce anew subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gasusing Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approachbased on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies withresolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of freeparameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model intothree sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth. As part of themodel, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulentvelocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the localvelocity gradients. We verify the different components of the framework throughextensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across differentsimulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, theturbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation ofturbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and withoutcold gas growth. We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreementacross the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both localturbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like thecold gas survival criteria as an emergent property. We discuss the applicationsand possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running asimulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolvedsingle-fluid simulation.",12/4/2024,"['turbulentvelocities', 'largeseparation', 'astrophysical', 'hot', 'turbulent']"
Free-form intelligent hydrodynamic metamaterials enabled by extreme  anisotropy,"Abstract: Intelligent metamaterials have attracted widespread research interest due totheir self-adaptive capabilities and controllability. They hold great potentialfor advancing fluid control by providing responsive and flexible solutions.However, current designs of passive hydrodynamic metamaterials are limited bytheir fixed shapes and specific environments, lacking environmentaladaptability. These two constraints hinder the broader application ofhydrodynamic metamaterials. In this work, we propose a design for passiveintelligent metashells that utilize extremely anisotropic parameters to endowhydrodynamic metamaterials with self-adaptive abilities and free-form shapes.Achieving the required anisotropic parameters is challenging, but weingeniously accomplished this by creating isobaric conditions throughincreasing the water height in the shell region. We validated the designthrough finite-element simulations. This approach overcomes the limitations ofexisting passive hydrodynamic metamaterials, enhancing their intelligentbehavior. Our model improves the flexibility and robustness of hydrodynamicmetamaterials in complex and dynamic environments, providing insights forfuture designs and practical applications",12/4/2024,"['hydrodynamicmetamaterials', 'intelligentbehavior', 'hydrodynamic', 'endowhydrodynamic', 'environmentaladaptability']"
Fingering instability in dewetting capillary nanosuspensions,"Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms when a capillarynanosuspension liquid bridge is stretched. The dewetting process is observedusing a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched underconstant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recordedusing two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of theSaffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites andthe overlapped number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles ofmicroparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingeringinstability. Addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger lengthdue to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles.Addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a stronginterparticle network. Incorporation of Nanoparticles induces an early onset ofcavitation and enhanced fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make thecapillary suspensions' overall micro-structure more homogeneous, reduce thesample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution ofgel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complexinteractions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledgehas potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-filmcoatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.",12/4/2024,"['nanoparticles', 'filmcoatings', 'fingeringinstability', 'complexinteractions', 'thecapillary']"
Turbulent boundary development over an air cavity,"Abstract: The turbulent boundary layer (TBL) development over an air cavity isexperimentally studied using planar particle image velocimetry. The presentflow, representative of those typically encountered in ship air lubrication,resembles the geometrical characteristics of flows over solid bumps studied inliterature. However, unlike solid bumps, the cavity has a variable geometryinherent to its dynamic nature. An identification technique based onthresholding of correlation values from particle image correlations is employedto detect the cavity. The TBL does not separate at the leeward side of thecavity owing to a high boundary layer thickness to maximum cavity thicknessratio ($\delta/t_{max}=12$). As a consequence of the cavity geometry, the TBLis subjected to alternating streamwise pressure gradients: from an adversepressure gradient (APG) to a favourable pressure gradient and back to an APG.The mean streamwise velocity and turbulence stresses over the cavity show thatthe streamwise pressure gradients and air injection are the dominantperturbations to the flow, with streamline curvature concluded to be marginal.Two-point correlations of the wall-normal velocity reveal an increased coherentextent over the cavity and a local anisotropy in regions under an APG, distinctfrom traditional APG TBLs, suggesting possible history effects.",12/3/2024,"['geometryinherent', 'turbulence', 'lubrication', 'velocimetry', 'inliterature']"
An extended analytical wake model and applications to yawed wind  turbines in atmospheric boundary layers with different levels of  stratification and veer,"Abstract: Analytical wake models provide a computationally efficient means to predictvelocity distributions in wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer(ABL). Most existing models are developed for neutral atmospheric conditionsand correspondingly neglect the effects of buoyancy and Coriolis forces thatlead to veer, i.e. changes in the wind direction with height. Both veer andchanges in thermal stratification lead to lateral shearing of the wake behind awind turbine, which affects the power output of downstream turbines. Here wedevelop an analytical engineering wake model for a wind turbine in yaw in ABLflows including Coriolis and thermal stratification effects. The model combinesthe new analytical representation of ABL vertical structure based on couplingEkman and surface layer descriptions (Narasimhan, Gayme, and Meneveau, 2024a)with the vortex sheet-based wake model for yawed turbines (Bastankhah et al.,2022), as well as a new method to predict the wake expansion rate based on theTownsend-Perry logarithmic scaling of streamwise velocity variance. Theproposed wake model's predictions show good agreement with Large EddySimulation (LES) results, capturing the effects of wind veer and yawingincluding the curled and sheared wake structures across various states of theABL, ranging from neutrally to strongly stably stratified atmosphericconditions. The model significantly improves power loss predictions from wakeinteractions, especially in strongly stably stratified conditions where windveer effects dominate.",12/3/2024,"['turbines', 'turbine', 'windveer', 'wakeinteractions', 'atmosphericconditions']"
Universal energy cascade in critically balanced homogeneous ferrofluid  turbulence,"Abstract: In ferrofluids, the vorticity is balanced by the rate of particle rotation,which is known here as critical balance. The universal energy cascade isinvestigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluidturbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderatemagnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. Asthe external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascadebecomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade'suniversal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression ofturbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.",12/2/2024,"['ferrofluidturbulent', 'magnetic', 'ferrofluids', 'universal', 'rotation']"
Stationary and non-stationary energy cascades in homogeneous ferrofluid  turbulence,"Abstract: The nonlinear transfer rate of the total energy (transfer rate of kineticenergy + transfer rate due to the work done by the magnetization) for anincompressible turbulent ferrofluid system is studied under the assumption ofstatistical homogeneity. Using the formalism of the two-point correlators, anexact relation connecting the second-order statistical moments to the averageenergy injection rate is derived for the scale-to scale transfer of the totalenergy. We validate the universality of the exact relation through directnumerical simulations for stationary and non-stationary cascade regimes. For aweak external magnetic field, both kinetic and the total energy cascade withnearly the same cascade rate. A stationary cascade regime is achieved and hencea good agreement between the exact energy transfer rate and the average energyinjection is found. Due to the rapid alignment of the ferrofluid particles inthe presence of strong external fields, the turbulence dynamics becomesnon-stationary. Interestingly, there too, both kinetic and the total energyexhibit inertial range cascades but with different cascade rates which can beexplained using the non-stationary form of our derived exact relation.",5/7/2024,"['kineticenergy', 'energyinjection', 'ferrofluid', 'totalenergy', 'energyexhibit']"
Fingering instability of self-similar radial flow of miscible fluids in  a Hele-Shaw cell,Abstract: The linear stability of miscible displacement for radial source flow atinfinite P\'eclet number in a Hele-Shaw cell is calculated theoretically. Theaxisymmetric self-similar flow is shown to be unstable to viscous fingering ifthe viscosity ratio $m$ between ambient and injected fluids exceeds $3\over2$and to be stable if $m<{3\over2}$. If $1<m<{3\over2}$ small disturbances decayat rates between $t^{-3/4}$ and $t^{-1}$ relative to the $t^{1/2}$ radius ofthe axisymmetric base-state similarity solution; if $m<1$ they decay fasterthan $t^{-1}$.

AAROC: Reduced Over-Collocation Method with Adaptive Time Partitioning  and Adaptive Enrichment for Parametric Time-Dependent Equations,"Abstract: Nonlinear and nonaffine terms in parametric partial differential equationscan potentially lead to a computational cost of a reduced order model (ROM)that is comparable to the cost of the original full order model (FOM). Toaddress this, the Reduced Residual Reduced Over-Collocation method (R2-ROC) isdeveloped as a hyper-reduction method within the framework of the reduced basismethod in the collocation setting. R2-ROC greedily selects two sets of reducedcollocation points based on the (generalized) empirical interpolation methodfor both solution snapshots and residuals, thereby avoiding the computationalinefficiency. The vanilla R2-ROC method can face instability when applied toparametric fluid dynamic problems. To address this, an adaptive enrichmentstrategy has been proposed to stabilize the ROC method. However, this strategycan involve in an excessive number of reduced collocation points, therebynegatively impacting online efficiency.To ensure both efficiency and accuracy, we propose an adaptive timepartitioning and adaptive enrichment strategy-based ROC method (AAROC). Theadaptive time partitioning dynamically captures the low-rank structure,necessitating fewer reduced collocation points being sampled in each timesegment. Numerical experiments on the parametric viscous Burgers' equation andlid-driven cavity problems demonstrate the efficiency, enhanced stability, andaccuracy of the proposed AAROC method.",12/3/2024,"['computationalinefficiency', 'enrichmentstrategy', 'reducedcollocation', 'equationscan', 'computational']"
Geometry-aware PINNs for Turbulent Flow Prediction,"Abstract: Design exploration or optimization using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)is commonly used in the industry. Geometric variation is a key component ofsuch design problems, especially in turbulent flow scenarios, which involvesrunning costly simulations at every design iteration. While parametricRANS-PINN type approaches have been proven to make effective turbulentsurrogates, as a means of predicting unknown Reynolds number flows for a givengeometry at near real-time, geometry aware physics informed surrogates with theability to predict varying geometries are a relatively less studied topic. Anovel geometry aware parametric PINN surrogate model has been created, whichcan predict flow fields for NACA 4 digit airfoils in turbulent conditions, forunseen shapes as well as inlet flow conditions. A local+global approach forembedding has been proposed, where known global design parameters for anairfoil as well as local SDF values can be used as inputs to the model alongwith velocity inlet/Reynolds number ($\mathcal{R}_e$) to predict the flowfields. A RANS formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with a 2-equationk-epsilon turbulence model has been used for the PDE losses, in addition tolimited CFD data from 8 different NACA airfoils for training. The models havethen been validated with unknown NACA airfoils at unseen Reynolds numbers.",12/2/2024,"['turbulentsurrogates', 'mathcal', 'computational', 'equations', 'turbulence']"
Study on Dynamic Solidification of Digital Droplets and Random Behaviors  during the Recalescence Process in a Spiral-shaped Milli-reactor,"Abstract: In this study, we designed a spiral-shaped milli-reactor with a T-junctionmicrochannel to generate digital droplets for studying and observing thedigital freezing process of droplets. During the study of the recalescence andsolidification processes of digital droplets dynamically moving inmicrochannels, we found that although the digital generation of droplets in ourchannel aligns well with the literature, achieving the digitalization of thedroplet freezing process is very challenging. Even the initial phase offreezing (the recalescence process) exhibits significant randomness. A keyfeature of the randomness in the freezing process is the nucleation position ofdroplets within the channel, which significantly impacts the digitalcharacteristics and hinders digital freezing. During the investigation offreezing randomness, we identified five distinct nucleation profiles, whichlargely determine the evolution of the freezing front and the duration of therecalescence phase. However, upon studying the motion velocity of the freezingfront, we found that these velocities are temperature-dependent. This alignswith the results of our phase-field simulations and experimental findings,indicating that the release of latent heat during the recalescence process isstable. Additionally, the randomness in freezing may also stem from thedeformation of droplets during the solidification process. In this study, weidentified two distinct solidification modes during the freezing phase: oneinitiating from the droplet's head or tail and the other starting from themiddle, with the latter causing significant droplet deformation. Throughstatistical analysis, we further explored the influence of flow rate variationon the digital clustering of droplet freezing and discovered flow rateparameters that optimize freezing digitalization.",12/2/2024,"['digitalcharacteristics', 'reactor', 'digitalization', 'junctionmicrochannel', 'inmicrochannels']"

Main problems in constructing quantum theory based on finite mathematics,"Abstract: As shown in our publications, quantum theory based on a finite ring ofcharacteristic $p$ (FQT) is more general than standard quantum theory (SQT)because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit$p\to\infty$. One of the main differences between SQT and FQT is the following.In SQT, elementary objects are described by irreducible representations (IRs)of a symmetry algebra in which energies are either only positive or onlynegative and there are no IRs where there are states with different signs ofenergy. In the first case, objects are called particles, and in the second -antiparticles. As a consequence, in SQT it is possible to introduce conservedquantum numbers (electric charge, baryon number, etc.) so that particles andantiparticles differ in the signs of these numbers. However, in FQT, all IRsnecessarily contain states with both signs of energy. The symmetry in FQT ishigher than the symmetry in SQT because one IR in FQT splits into two IRs inSQT with positive and negative energies at $p\to\infty$. Consequently, mostfundamental quantum theory will not contain the concepts ofparticle-antiparticle and additive quantum numbers. These concepts are onlygood approximations at present since at this stage of the universe the value$p$ is very large but it was not so large at earlier stages. The aboveproperties of IRs in SQT and FQT have been discussed in our publications withdetailed technical proofs. The purpose of this paper is to consider modelswhere these properties can be derived in a much simpler way.",11/26/2024,"['algebra', 'quantum', 'ofenergy', 'ofcharacteristic', 'electric']"

"Black Hole Orbit Classification: The Synergistic Effects of Cloud  Strings, Gauss-Bonnet Terms, and Non-Commutative Parameters in Identifying  WGC candidate Models: WGC as WCCC protector","Abstract: The integration of non-commutative geometry and Gauss-Bonnet corrections inan action and the study of their black hole responses can provide highlyintriguing insights. Our primary motivation for this study is to understand theinterplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, includingphoton spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that thisintegration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnetparameter ($\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in thenon-commutative parameter ($\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure canonly manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a morecomplex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings andlinear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield differentand varied results. In this scenario, negative $\alpha$ values can also play arole, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge($q > m$). For $\alpha> 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomessignificantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of otherparameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive blackhole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within thesuper-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to ourmain goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that bothsituations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior ofthese two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and aprotector for the WCCC.",11/26/2024,"['spacetime', 'otherparameter', 'bonnetparameter', 'gauss', 'geodesics']"
New Weighted Sum of Gray Gases (WSGG) Models for Radiation Calculation  in Carbon Capture Simulations: Evaluation and Different Implementation  Techniques,"Abstract: We apply several weighted sum of gray gases models (WSGGMs) to calculate theradiative absorption coefficient for gas mixtures containing H2O and CO2. Ourmain objectives are to analyze and compare four WSGGMs which have been recentlydeveloped for oxy-fuel combustion. The models are compared with the widely-usedair-fuel WSGGM of Smith et al. In addition to direct comparison of theabsorption coefficients, we compare finite-volume solutions of the radiativeequation of transfer in a 2m x 2m x 4m box with a specified inhomogeneoustemperature field and a homogeneous mixture of the H2O, CO2 and N2.Calculations using a spectral line-based WSGGM (SLW) are used as a referencesolution to estimate the accuracy. For each WSGGM, we apply two interpolationmethods for determining the model coefficients at arbitrary H2O-to-CO2 ratios.For wet-recycle oxy-fuel combustion, we found that the deviation of theair-fuel WSGGM was not significantly larger than several of the newer models.However, with dry recycle (90 vol%-CO2) the air-fuel WSGGM model underpredictsthe radiative flux and radiative heat source in contrast to the other modelswhich overpredict these fields. Piecewise linear interpolation consistentlyimproves the predictions of the air-fuel WSGGM, but only has a modest effect onthe predictions of the oxy-fuel WSGGM's.",11/27/2024,"['co2', 'recycle', 'interpolationmethods', 'gas', 'inhomogeneoustemperature']"

Atfirst, we review briefly the characteristics of the Riemann hypothesis and itsconnections to physics, in particular, to statistical physics. Second, we builda 2D Ising model, M_(FI+SGI)^2D, in which interactions between the nearestneighboring spins are ferromagnetic along one crystallographic direction whilecompeting ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are randomly distributedalong another direction. Third, we prove that all energy eigenvalues of this 2DIsing model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are real and randomly distributed as the M\""obiusfunction {\mu}(n), the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function as well as the Riemannzeta function {\zeta}(s). Fourth, we prove that the eigenvectors of the 2DIsing model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are constructed by the eigenvectors of the 1D Isingmodel with phases related to the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s), via therelation {\omega}({\gamma}_2j) between the angle {\omega} and the energyeigenvalues {\gamma}_2j, which form the Hilbert-P\'olya space. Fifth, we provethat all the zeros of the partition function of the 2D Ising modelM_(FI+SGI)^2D lie on an unit circle in a complex temperature plane (i.e. Fisherzeros), which can be mapped to the zero distribution of the DirichletL(s,\c{hi}_k ) function and also the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) in thecritical line. In a conclusion, we have proven the closure of the nontrivialzero distribution of the L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function (including the Riemann zetafunction {\zeta}(s)).",11/25/2024,"['physics', 'riemann', 'zetafunction', 'eigenvalues', 'crystallographic']"
Nongray EWB and WSGG Radiation Modeling in Oxy-Fuel Environments,"Abstract: According to a recent U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1), about 42%of 2008 CO$_2$ (a greenhouse gas) emissions in the US were from burning fossilfuels (especially coal) to generate electricity. The 2010 U.S. InternationalEnergy Outlook (2) predicts that the world energy generation using coal andnatural gas will continue to increase steadily in the future. This results inincreased concentrations of atmospheric CO$_2$, and calls for serious effortsto control its emissions from power plants through carbon capture technologies.Oxy-fuel combustion is a carbon capture technology in which the fossil fuel isburned in an atmosphere free from nitrogen, thereby significantly reducing therelative amount of N$_2$ in the flue-gas and increasing the mole fractions ofH$_2$O and CO$_2$. This low concentration of N$_2$ facilitates the capture ofCO$_2$. The dramatic change in the flue composition results in changes in itsthermal, chemical, and radiative properties. From the modeling point of view,existing transport, combustion, and radiation models that have parameters tunedfor air-fuel combustion (where N$_2$ is the dominant gaseous species in theflue) may need revision to improve the predictions of numerical simulations ofoxy-fuel combustion. In this chapter, we consider recent efforts done to reviseradiation modeling for oxy-fuel combustion, where five new radiative-propertymodels were proposed to be used in oxy-fuel environments. All these models usethe weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model (WSGGM). We apply and compare theirperformance in two oxy-fuel environments. Both environments consist of onlyH$_2$O and CO$_2$ as mixture species, and thus there is no N$_2$ dilution, butthe environments vary in the mole fractions of these two species.",11/24/2024,"['coal', 'fossilfuels', '2010', '2008', 'gas']"
Gaussian Processes for Probabilistic Estimates of Earthquake Ground  Shaking: A 1-D Proof-of-Concept,"Abstract: Estimates of seismic wave speeds in the Earth (seismic velocity models) arekey input parameters to earthquake simulations for ground motion prediction.Owing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically manyvelocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of whichvelocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motionpredictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for thissource of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion predictionworkflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies betweenexisting seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilisticfusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process(GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocityprofiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts forthe differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samplesfrom the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement usingacoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resultingdistribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would bepredicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. Thisproof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods forphysics-based seismic hazard analysis.",12/4/2024,"['seismic', 'earthquake', 'velocityprofiles', 'motionpredictions', 'predictionworkflow']"
Coupled Boundary Element and Finite Volume Methods for Modeling  Fluid-Induced Seismicity in Fault Networks within Low-Permeability Rocks,"Abstract: To better understand the mechanics of injection-induced seismicity, wedeveloped a two-dimensional numerical code to simulate both seismic andaseismic slip on non-planar faults and fault networks driven by fluid diffusionalong permeable faults. Our approach integrates a boundary element method tomodel fault slip governed by rate-and-state friction with a finite volumemethod for simulating fluid diffusion along fault networks. We demonstrate themethod's capabilities with two illustrative examples: (1) fluid injectioninducing slow slip on a primary rough, rate-strengthening fault, whichsubsequently triggers microseismicity on secondary, smaller faults, and (2)fluid injection on a single fault in a network of intersecting faults, leadingto fluid diffusion and reactivation of slip throughout the network. In bothcases, the simulated slow slip migrates more rapidly than the fluid pressurediffusion front. The observed migration patterns of microseismicity in thefirst example and slow slip in the second example resemble diffusion processesbut involve diffusivity values that differ significantly from the faulthydraulic diffusivity. These results support the conclusion that themicroseismicity front is not a direct proxy for the fluid diffusion front andcannot be used to directly infer hydraulic diffusivity, consistently with somedecametric scale in-situ experiments of fault activation under controlledconditions. This work highlights the importance of distinguishing betweenmechanical and hydrological processes in the analysis of induced seismicity,providing a powerful tool for improving our understanding of fault behavior inresponse to fluid injection, in particular when a network of faults isinvolved.",12/4/2024,"['injectioninducing', 'faulthydraulic', 'seismicity', 'seismic', 'hydraulic']"
Bounds on the complex viscoelasticity for surface waves on ice-covered  seas,"Abstract: Oceanic wave propagation through Earth's sea ice covers is a criticalcomponent of accurate ice and climate modeling. Continuum models of the polarocean surface layer are characterized rheologically by the effective complexviscoelasticity of the composite of ice floes and sea water. Here we presentthe first rigorous theory of this parameter, and distill its dependence onmixture geometry into the spectral properties of a self-adjoint operatoranalogous to the Hamiltonian in quantum physics. Bounds for the complexviscoelasticity are obtained from the sea ice concentration and the contrastbetween the elastic and viscous properties of the ice and water/slushconstituents. We find that several published wave attenuation datasets in bothlaboratory and field settings fall well within the bounds for specific contrastvalues of the ice/ocean composite.",12/2/2024,"['polarocean', 'ocean', 'oceanic', 'physics', 'ice']"
QuakeFormer: A Uniform Approach to Earthquake Ground Motion Prediction  Using Masked Transformers,"Abstract: Ground motion prediction (GMP) models are critical for hazard reductionbefore, during and after destructive earthquakes. In these three stages,intensity forecasting, early warning and interpolation models are correspondingemployed to assess the risk. Considering the high cost in numerical methods andthe oversimplification in statistical methods, deep-learning-based approachesaim to provide accurate and near-real-time ground motion prediction. Currentapproaches are limited by specialized architectures, overlooking theinterconnection among these three tasks. What's more, the inadequate modelingof absolute and relative spatial dependencies mischaracterizes epistemicuncertainty into aleatory variability. Here we introduce QuakeFormer, a unifieddeep learning architecture that combines these three tasks in one framework. Wedesign a multi-station-based Transformer architecture and a flexible maskingstrategy for training QuakeFormer. This data-driven approach enables the modelto learn spatial ground motion dependencies directly from real seismicrecordings, incorporating location embeddings that include both absolute andrelative spatial coordinates. The results indicate that our model outperformsstate-of-the-art ground motion prediction models across all three tasks in ourresearch areas. We also find that pretraining a uniform forecasting andinterpolation model enhances the performance on early warning task. QuakeFormeroffers a flexible approach to directly learning and modeling ground motion,providing valuable insights and applications for both earthquake science andengineering.",12/1/2024,"['quakeformeroffers', 'quakeformer', 'seismicrecordings', 'earthquakes', 'earthquake']"
Well log data generation and imputation using sequence-based generative  adversarial networks,"Abstract: Well log analysis is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, providing detailedinsights into subsurface geological formations. However, gaps and inaccuraciesin well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges,and harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties inreservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methodsfor both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data,ensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novelframework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs)specifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. Theframework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN(TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) forimputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea,Netherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 datapoints. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superioraccuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models forspatial series analysis. The method yielded R^2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012,0.005, and 0.032, respectively.

Analysis of thefrequency equations relating Young's modulus to the out of plane and in planeflexural resonant frequencies of rectangular prisms has been conducted for boththe fundamental frequency and its overtones at higher orders of vibration. TheYoung's modulus of three novaculite rocks with various porosities were thenmeasured up to the seventh order of vibration to validate the optimum shearconstant equation for estimating Young's modulus.

High Magnitude Earthquake Identification Using an Anomaly Detection  Approach on HR GNSS Data,"Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems are crucial for protecting areas that aresubject to these natural disasters. An essential part of these systems is thedetection procedure. Traditionally these systems work with seismograph data,but high rate GNSS data has become a promising alternative for the usage inlarge earthquake early warning systems. Besides traditional methods, deeplearning approaches have gained recent popularity in this field, as they areable to leverage the large amounts of real and synthetic seismic data.Nevertheless, the usage of deep learning on GNSS data remains a comparativelynew topic. This work contributes to the field of early warning systems byproposing an autoencoder based deep learning pipeline that aims to belightweight and customizable for the detection of anomalies viz. high magnitudeearthquakes in GNSS data. This model, DetEQ, is trained using the noise datarecordings from nine stations located in Chile. The detection pipelineencompasses: (i) the generation of an anomaly score using the ground truth andreconstructed output from the autoencoder, (ii) the detection of relevantseismic events through an appropriate threshold, and (iii) the filtering oflocal events, that would lead to false positives. Robustness of the model wastested on the HR GNSS real data of 2011 Mw 6.8 Concepcion earthquake recordedat six stations.

Key features of TomoATT include Eikonal equation modeling,adjoint-state method, sensitivity kernel regularization, and multi-levelparallelization. Through several toy experiments, we demonstrate TomoATT'scapability in accurate forward modeling, handling multipathing phenomenon,delivering reliable tomographic results, and achieving high-performanceparallelization. Additionally, TomoATT is benchmarked with a syntheticexperiment and two real-data applications in central California near Parkfieldand Thailand. The successful recovery of the synthetic model, along with theimaging results that are consistent with previous studies and regionaltectonics, verifies the effectiveness of TomoATT. Each inversion starts withonly three simple input files (about model, data, and parameters) and completeswithin 2 hours using 64 processors.

Spatial-variant causal Bayesian inference for rapid seismic ground  failures and impacts estimation,"Abstract: Rapid and accurate estimation of post-earthquake ground failures and buildingdamage is critical for effective post-disaster responses. Progression in remotesensing technologies has paved the way for rapid acquisition of detailed,localized data, enabling swift hazard estimation through analysis ofcorrelation deviations between pre- and post-quake satellite imagery. However,discerning seismic hazards and their impacts is challenged by overlappingsatellite signals from ground failures, building damage, and environmentalnoise. Previous advancements introduced a novel causal graph-based Bayesiannetwork that continually refines seismic ground failure and building damageestimates derived from satellite imagery, accounting for the intricateinterplay among geospatial elements, seismic activity, ground failures,building structures, damages, and satellite data. However, this model's neglectof spatial heterogeneity across different locations in a seismic region limitsits precision in capturing the spatial diversity of seismic effects. In thisstudy, we pioneer an approach that accounts for spatial intricacies byintroducing a spatial variable influenced by the bilateral filter to capturerelationships from surrounding hazards. The bilateral filter considers bothspatial proximity of neighboring hazards and their ground shaking intensityvalues, ensuring refined modeling of spatial relationships. This integrationachieves a balance between site-specific characteristics and spatialtendencies, offering a comprehensive representation of the post-disasterlandscape. Our model, tested across multiple earthquake events, demonstratessignificant improvements in capturing spatial heterogeneity in seismic hazardestimation. The results highlight enhanced accuracy and efficiency inpost-earthquake large-scale multi-impact estimation, effectively informingrapid disaster responses.",11/18/2024,"['seismic', 'disasterlandscape', 'earthquake', 'quake', 'geospatial']"
Anthropogenic actinides in seawater and biota from the west coast of  Sweden,"Abstract: The assessment of the origin of the anthropogenic contamination in marineregions impacted by other sources than global fallout is a challenge. This isthe case of the west coast of Sweden, influenced by the liquid effluentsreleased by the European Nuclear Reprocessing Plants through North Sea currentsand by Baltic Sea local and regional sources, among others. This work focusedon the study of anthropogenic actinides (${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and${}^{239,240}$Pu) in seawater and biota from a region close to Gothenburg whereradioactive wastes with an unknown composition were dumped in 1964. To thisaim, a radiochemical procedure for the sequential extraction of U, Np and Pufrom biota samples and the subsequent analysis of ${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np,${}^{239}$Pu and ${}^{240}$Pu by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry was developed.The method was validated through the study of two reference materials providedby the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): IAEA-446 (Baltic Sea seaweed)and IAEA-437 (Mediterranean Sea mussels). The ${}^{233}$U$/{}^{236}$U atomratio was also studied in the seawater samples. The obtained results indicatethat the North Sea currents and global fallout are the major sources for${}^{236}$U, ${}^{237}$Np and ${}^{239,240}$Pu to the studied area, with anyclear evidence of other local sources. Complementary, information on theConcentrations Factors (CF) in biota was obtained, for which the availableinformation is very scarce. For seaweed, CF values of $(4.1 \pm 1.1) \times10^{3}$, $88 \pm 51$ and $70 \pm 20$ have been obtained for Pu, Np and U,respectively.

Importance of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behaviour induced  by pressure-solution,"Abstract: Pressure-solution is a chemo-mechanical process, involving dissolution atgrain/asperity contacts and precipitation away from them. It induces acompaction in time of rocks and sediments. The present study investigatesnumerically the impact of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behaviorinduced by pressure-solution. A recently published framework, called thePhase-Field Discrete Element Model, is carefully calibrated against existingindentation experiments and validated for other rate-limiting scenarios. It isshown that when precipitation is relatively slow, the slowdown ofpressure-solution is due to a chemical mechanism (accumulation of soluteconcentration within the pore space), whereas, at fast precipitation, theslowdown is due to a mechanical mechanism (stress reduction at the contact).",12/2/2024,"['sediments', 'slowdown', 'soluteconcentration', 'theslowdown', 'investigatesnumerically']"
Diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a mixture of  electrolytes,"Abstract: Current theories of diffusiophoresis in porous media are limited to a porousmedium saturated with a valence symmetric electrolyte. A predictive model fordiffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a valence asymmetricelectrolyte, or a general mixture of valence symmetric and asymmetricelectrolytes, is lacking. To close this knowledge gap, in this work we developa mathematical model, based upon the regular perturbation method and numericalintegration, to compute the diffusiophoretic mobility of a colloid in porousmedia saturated with a general mixture of electrolytes. We model theelectrokinetics using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and the fluidtransport in porous media using the Brinkman equation with an electric bodyforce. We report three novel key findings. First, we demonstrate that, in thesame electrolyte concentration gradient, lowering the permeability of theporous medium can significantly weaken the colloid diffusiophoretic motion.Second, we show that, surprisingly, by using a valence asymmetric electrolytethe colloid diffusiophoretic motion in a denser porous medium can be strongerthan that in a less dense porous medium saturated with a symmetric electrolyte.Third, we demonstrate that varying the composition of an electrolyte mixturedoes not only change the strength of the colloid diffusiophoretic motiondrastically, but also qualitatively its direction. The model developed fromthis work can be used to understand and predict natural phenomena such asintracellular transport, as well as design technological applications such asenhanced oil recovery, nanoparticle drug delivery, and colloidal speciesseparation.",12/1/2024,"['asymmetricelectrolytes', 'asymmetricelectrolyte', 'porousmedium', 'nanoparticle', 'numericalintegration']"
Terrestrial atmospheric ion implantation occurred in the nearside lunar  regolith during the history of Earth's dynamo,"Abstract: Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of thesolar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence ofgeomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitivegeodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear,and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition andpoorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHDnumerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetizedatmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects thistransfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signatureprovides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transferis efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solarcontribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during thelong history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetizedepoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrialatmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunarsoils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples arevery sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ionimplantation, was never smaller than 190 km.",11/30/2024,"['lunarsoils', 'lunar', 'moon', 'solarcontribution', 'unmagnetizedatmospheres']"
Automatic Differentiation-based Full Waveform Inversion with Flexible  Workflows,"Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is able to construct high-resolution subsurfacemodels by iteratively minimizing discrepancies between observed and simulatedseismic data. However, its implementation can be rather involved for complexwave equations, objective functions, or regularization. Recently, automaticdifferentiation (AD) has proven to be effective in simplifying solutions ofvarious inverse problems, including FWI. In this study, we present anopen-source AD-based FWI framework (ADFWI), which is designed to simplify thedesign, development, and evaluation of novel approaches in FWI withflexibility. The AD-based framework not only includes forword modeling andassociated gradient computations for wave equations in various types of mediafrom isotropic acoustic to vertically or horizontally transverse isotropicelastic, but also incorporates a suite of objective functions, regularizationtechniques, and optimization algorithms. By leveraging state-of-the-art AD,objective functions such as soft dynamic time warping and Wasserstein distance,which are difficult to apply in traditional FWI are also easily integrated intoADFWI. In addition, ADFWI is integrated with deep learning for implicit modelreparameterization via neural networks, which not only introduces learnedregularization but also allows rapid estimation of uncertainty through dropout.To manage high memory demands in large-scale inversion associated with AD, theproposed framework adopts strategies such as mini-batch and checkpointing.Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the novelty, practicality androbustness of ADFWI, which can be used to address challenges in FWI and as aworkbench for prompt experiments and the development of new inversionstrategies.",11/30/2024,"['automaticdifferentiation', 'modelreparameterization', 'simplifying', 'regularizationtechniques', 'algorithms']"
Enhanced anomaly detection in well log data through the application of  ensemble GANs,"Abstract: Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown significantsuccess in modeling data distributions for image datasets, their application tostructured or tabular data, such as well logs, remains relativelyunderexplored. This study extends the ensemble GANs (EGANs) framework tocapture the distribution of well log data and detect anomalies that falloutside of these distributions. The proposed approach compares the performanceof traditional methods, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), with EGANs indetecting anomalies outside the expected data distributions. For the gamma ray(GR) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.62 and F1 score of 0.76,outperforming GMM's precision of 0.38 and F1 score of 0.54. Similarly, fortravel time (DT), EGANs achieved a precision of 0.70 and F1 score of 0.79,surpassing GMM 0.56 and 0.71. In the neutron porosity (NPHI) dataset, EGANsrecorded a precision of 0.53 and F1 score of 0.68, outshining GMM 0.47 and0.61. For the bulk density (RHOB) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.52and an F1 score of 0.67, slightly outperforming GMM, which yielded a precisionof 0.50 and an F1 score of 0.65. This work's novelty lies in applying EGANs forwell log data analysis, showcasing their ability to learn data patterns andidentify anomalies that deviate from them. This approach offers more reliableanomaly detection compared to traditional methods like GMM. The findingshighlight the potential of EGANs in enhancing anomaly detection for well logdata, delivering significant implications for optimizing drilling strategiesand reservoir management through more accurate, data-driven insights intosubsurface characterization.",11/29/2024,"['findingshighlight', 'intosubsurface', 'egansrecorded', 'relativelyunderexplored', 'insights']"
Exploring the conditions conducive to convection within the Greenland  Ice Sheet,"Abstract: Plumes within the Greenland Ice Sheet disrupt radiostratigraphy andcomplicate the use of isochrones in reconstructions of past ice dynamics.

Greater horizontal shear and snowaccumulation impede plume formation, while stable and softer ice encouragesthem. These results potentially explain the dearth of basal plumes in theyounger and higher-accumulation southern ice sheet. Leveraging this mechanismto place bounds on ice rheology suggests that -- for north Greenland -- iceviscosity may be \(\sim\)9-15 times lower than commonly assumed.Softer-than-assumed ice there implies significantly reduced basal slidingcompared to standard models.

HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory  Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core,"Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volumeshallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. Thisdynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essentialnon-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the codedevelopment is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on bothCPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automaticdifferentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order PredictionEnvironment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensionaltensor product polynomial and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted EssentiallyNon-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that theaccuracy can reach arbitrary order. The algorithm has very high degree ofcompatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to bemitigated through the utilization of GPU. The LMARS (Low Mach numberApproximate Riemann Solver) scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determinefluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between eachcell edge is computed using linear Gaussian quadrature, and the tendency ofprognostic values is obtained by summing all fluxes around the cell. Thisshallow water dynamic core demonstrates outstanding performance in idealshallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th orderscheme reduces errors to nearly round-off error even on coarse grids (2degrees). Furthermore, the Rossby-Haurwitz wave preserves its shape for over 90days. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam breakcase. The WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, andthe genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly betterisotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.",11/28/2024,"['automaticdifferentiation', 'gpu', 'predictionenvironment', 'riemann', 'polynomial']"
"Seismic swarms unveil the mechanisms driving shallow slow slip dynamics  in the Copiapó ridge, Northern Chile","Abstract: Like earthquakes, slow slip events release elastic energy stored on faults.Yet, the mechanisms behind slow slip instability and its relationship withseismicity are debated.

We observedense, migrating seismic swarms accompanying the SSE, comprised of interfaceactivity and upper plate splay faulting. Our observations suggest that the slowslip initiation is driven by structurally-confined fluid overpressure in thefluid-rich surroundings of a subducted seamount. This is consistent with anobserved acceleration and expansion of the SSE after a $M_L=5.3$ earthquakelikely triggering an increase in interface permeability. Historical earthquakeswarms highlight the persistent structural control and recurrent nature of suchslow slip events.

Quantification of Uncertainty and Its Propagation in Seismic Velocity  Structure and Earthquake Source Inversion,"Abstract: In earthquake source inversions aimed at understanding diverse faultactivities on earthquake faults using seismic observation data, uncertaintiesin velocity structure models are typically not considered.

The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle,"Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa andtemperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. Inthis work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram,elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes asignificant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capturein full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperaturesand pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochasticself-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase ofCaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. Thephase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order andincreases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accountingfor temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of soundas a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotationson the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past toexplain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermalconductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism,shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of thestandard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionicanharmonicity.",11/27/2024,"['ionicanharmonicity', 'thermodynamic', 'downplay', '1900', 'boltzmann']"

Algorithmic idealism: what should you believe to experience next?,"Abstract: I argue for an approach to the Foundations of Physics that puts the questionin the title center stage, rather than asking ""what is the case in the world?"".This approach, Algorithmic Idealism, attempts to give a mathematically rigorousin-principle-answer to this question both in the usual empirical regime ofphysics and more exotic regimes of cosmology, philosophy, and science fiction(but soon perhaps real) technology. I begin by arguing that quantum theory, inits actual practice and in some interpretations, should be understood astelling an agent what they should expect to observe next (rather than what isthe case), and that the difficulty of answering this former question from theusual ""external"" perspective is at the heart of persistent enigmas such as theBoltzmann brain problem, extended Wigner's friend scenarios, Parfit'steletransportation paradox, or our understanding of the simulation hypothesis.Algorithmic Idealism is a conceptual framework, based on two postulates thatadmit several possible mathematical formalizations, cast in the language ofalgorithmic information theory. Here I give a non-technical description of thisview and show how it dissolves the aforementioned enigmas: for example, itclaims that you should never bet on being a Boltzmann brain regardless of howmany there are, that shutting down computer simulations does not generallyterminate its inhabitants, and it predicts the apparent embedding into anobjective external world as an approximate description.",12/3/2024,"['physics', 'cosmology', 'quantum', 'philosophy', 'boltzmann']"
Spacetime Emergence and the Fear of Intimacy,"Abstract: We provide a reply to the Argument from Intimacy on behalf of defenders ofemergent spacetime in theories of quantum gravity. We argue that if one acceptsthat spacetime regions are nowhere in the sense that they are locations but donot have locations, then the Argument from Intimacy can be resolved. We go onto consider a problem with this response, namely that it is unavailable tosuper-substantivalists. We argue that this is right for identity but notpriority super-substantivalists. We then suggest that there is no cost for oursolution here, since identity versions of super-substantivalism face severechallenges in the context of spacetime emergence and so should be rejectedanyway.",12/2/2024,"['quantum', 'spacetime', 'theories', 'oursolution', 'acceptsthat']"
"Boundaries, frames and gravitational limits to objectivity","Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes andboundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical andquantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these researchdirections are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as differentaspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two mainphysical goals and one general conceptual aim. The physical goals are to movebeyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundaryconditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded incoordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelingof (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. The conceptual aim is to gain abetter understanding of the influence of observers in physics and the ensuinglimits of objectivity.",12/1/2024,"['physics', 'researchdirections', 'quantum', 'gravitational', 'research']"

"The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of  wave-particle duality","Abstract: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council,marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution.Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participatedin the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with hiswork. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother.Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to thewave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles.

An Astronomical Interpretation of the Nebra Sky Disc,"Abstract: We agree with the interpretation of W. Schlosser, that the Nebra Sky Disc isa reminder of a method of determining a start date (and possibly also an enddate) of the farming year. We extend this interpretation. We think that wefound the constellation Taurus on the Disc, which forms by addition of threestars from the constellation Gemini the pattern of a plough of Bronze Age.Moreover we found a line on the disc consisting of the stars epsilon Gem, thetaAur, beta Aur and alpha Aur, which we called the Auriga line. We think that theNebra people used the Auriga line to determine the day (which we call beta day)on which the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur at dusk in February. Wefound a second representation of the Auriga line on the Disc where the distanceratios between the stars are very precisely equal to the distance ratios in thesky, and where the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur. This proves that theNebra people must have measured the distances, and that our hypothesis iscorrect.The beta day could have been used to harmonize a lunisolar calendar with thesolar year. However, the most likely possibility seems to us that a good sowingdate could be determined by setting the sowing on the second round lunar phaseafter the beta day. (By round lunar phases we mean the full moon and the newmoon.) Such a sowing date makes it possible to start a week count based on thelunar phases with the sowing in order to determine other agricultural dates.The astronomical knowledge for this procedure can be gained by astronomicalobservations only. No mathematical calculations and import of knowledge from aMediterranean culture are necessary.",11/26/2024,"['astronomicalobservations', 'threestars', 'astronomical', 'constellation', 'sowingdate']"

PETAT -- An ASIC for Simple and Efficient Readout of Large PET Scanners,"Abstract: Modern PET scanners based on scintillating crystals use solid state photodetectors for light readout. The small area of these devices is beneficial forspatial resolution, but also leads to a large number of electronic channels tobe read out, mostly by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)containing amplification, noise reduction, hit finding, time stamping andamplitude measurement. Although each ASIC provides up to $\approx 64$ channels,a large number of chips is required with the need for auxiliary electroniccomponents like voltage regulators or FPGAs for control and data readout. TheFPGAs in turn often require multiple supply voltages and configurationinfrastructure, so that PCBs get complicated, cumbersome and power-hungry, inaddition to the significant power requirement of the front-end ASICs. Weaddress this issue in the latest generation of our PETA readout ASIC for SiPMsby a simplified control scheme and, in particular, by a hierarchical serialdata readout which does not require any additional FPGA. In addition, itprovides a time-sorted stream of hit data, allowing early on-detector datareduction and hit pre-processing like the removal of hits with no coincidentpartner. The simplicity of this readout facilitates a supply scheme wherepower/ground of multiple ASICs are connected in series instead of the standardparallel connection. This 'serial-powering' approach can reduce supply current(while increasing overall supply voltage) so that voltage drop issues in thesupply are alleviated.",12/3/2024,"['scanners', 'photodetectors', 'pcbs', 'crystals', 'configurationinfrastructure']"
Optical losses as a function of beam position on the mirrors in a 285-m  suspended Fabry-Perot cavity,"Abstract: Reducing optical losses is crucial for reducing quantum noise ingravitational-wave detectors. Losses are the main source of degradation of thesqueezed vacuum. Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity iscurrently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Suchfilter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce theoptimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularlydetrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within thecavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noisereduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of theoptical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of theVirgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses withrespect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses dependclearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87ppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61ppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical errorsmaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different withrespect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performedbefore the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major lossmechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The largerdiscrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination.In addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodologydescribed in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position forwhich the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. Thiswork can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for theoptical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.",12/3/2024,"['noisereduction', 'errorsmaller', 'lossmechanism', 'ingravitational', 'detectors']"
Performance of the LABDOS01 spectrometer in dosimetric measurements,"Abstract: This paper describes the performance of the LABDOS01, a silicon diode-basedspectrometer suitable for dose measurements in mixed radiation fields. Theinstrument is currently being used in two high-altitude environmental dosemonitoring projects: SAMADHA (South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly Dosimetry at HighAltitude) at Chacaltaya (Bolivia, 5240 m a.s.l.) and CORDIAL (COsmic RaysDosimetry In Antarctic Latitudes) at the Concordia station (Antarctica, 3233 ma.s.l.). Before installing two of these devices at the measurement sites, thedetectors were tested on flight routes covering a wide range of geomagneticlatitudes. The collected dosimetric data were compared with the expectationsderived by the CARI-7A software, which provides the absorbed dose rate insilicon due to cosmic ray secondaries at a given position on the Earth. Themeasured dose rates along the flights at variable altitude and rigidity cutoffagree well with the simulated ones. By analyzing the spectrum of the energydeposited in the silicon layer, we derive an empirical method to approximatelyevaluate the ambient dose equivalent $H^{*}(10)$, a quantity directly relatedto the biological damage caused by environmental radiation.",12/2/2024,"['antarctica', 'labdos01', 'antarctic', 'raysdosimetry', 'bolivia']"
Accurate transient heat flux from simple treatment of surface  temperature distribution in the semi-infinite case,"Abstract: When the variations of surface temperature are measured both spatially andtemporally, analytical expressions that correctly account for multi-dimensionaltransient conduction can be applied. To enhance the accessibility of theseaccurate multi-dimensional methods, expressions for converting between surfacetemperature and heat flux are presented as the sum of the one-dimensionalcomponent plus the multi-dimensional component. Advantage arises herein becausepotential numerical challenges are isolated within the one-dimensionalcomponent and practitioners are already familiar with well-establishedone-dimensional methods. The second derivative of the surface heat fluxdistribution scaled by the thermal diffusivity and the duration of theexperiment delivers an approximation of the multi-dimensional conduction term.For the analysis of experiments in which multi-dimensional effects aresignificant, a simplified numerical approach in which the temperature withineach pixel is treated as uniform is demonstrated. The approach involvesconvolution of temperature differences and pixel-based impulse responsefunctions, followed by a summation of results across the region of interest,but there are no singularities that require special treatment in themulti-dimensional component. Recovery of heat flux distributions to within 1%is demonstrated for two-dimensional heat flux distributions discretized usingseveral tens of elements, and for a three-dimensional distribution discretizedusing several hundred pixels. Higher accuracy can be achieved by using finerspatial resolution, but the level of discretization used herein is likelysufficient for practical applications since typical experimental uncertaintiesare much larger than 1%.",12/2/2024,"['surfacetemperature', 'thermal', 'fluxdistribution', 'dimensionaltransient', 'finerspatial']"
Monitoring of food spoilage by high resolution THz analysis,"Abstract: High resolution rotational Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has been widelyapplied to the studies of numerous polar gas phase molecules, in particularvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). During the storage of foodstuffs packedunder a protective atmosphere, microbial activity will lead to the generationof a complex mixture of trace gases that could be used as food spoilageindicators. Here we have demonstrated that the THz instrumentation presentlyavailable provides sufficient sensitivity and selectivity to monitor thegeneration of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the headspace of packed Atlantic salmon(Salmo salar) fillet portions. A comprehensive comparison was made byselective-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in order to validate theTHz measurements and protocol. The detectivity of a range of alternativecompounds for this application is also provided, based on the experimentaldetection limit observed and molecular spectroscopic properties.

Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise  measurements,"Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements is increased byamplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations awayfrom the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commerciallock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit aproblematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on therelative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-inamplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed usingopen-source software and inexpensive data acquisition systems. Our solutionoffers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltagepower spectral density by about two orders of magnitude compared to high-endcommercial instruments.",11/27/2024,"['amplifiers', 'modulation', 'spectral', 'voltagepower', 'reduction']"
Bulk-Surface Event Discrimination in Point Contact Germanium Detectors  at Near-Threshold Energies with Shape-Matching Pulse-Shape Methods,"Abstract: The p-type point-contact germanium (pPCGe) detectors have been widely adoptedin searches for low energy physics events such as neutrinos and dark matter.This is due to their enhanced capabilities of background rejection, sensitivityat energies as low as the sub-keV range and particularly fine energyresolution. Nonetheless, the pPCGe is subject to irregular behaviour caused bysurface effects for events near the passivated surface. These surface eventscan, in general, be distinguished from events that occur in the germaniumcrystal bulk by its slower pulse rise time. Unfortunately, the rise-timespectra of bulk and surface events starts to convolve with each other atsub-keV energies. In this work, we propose a novel method based oncross-correlation shape-matching combined with a low-pass filter to constrainthe initial parameter estimates of the signal pulse. This improvement at thelowest level leads to a 50% reduction in computation time and refinements inthe rise-time resolution, which will, in the end, enhance the overall analysis.To evaluate the performance of the method, we simulate artificial pulses thatresembles bulk and surface pulses by using a programmable pulse generatormodule (pulser). The pulser-generated pulses are then used to examine the pulsebehaviours at near-threshold energies, suggesting a roughly 70%background-leakage reduction in the bulk spectrum. Finally, the method istested on data collected from the TEXONO experiment, where the results areconsistent with our observations in pulser and demonstrated the possibility oflowering the analysis threshold by at least 10eV.",11/27/2024,"['neutrinos', 'physics', 'energyresolution', 'germaniumcrystal', 'detectors']"
Local Avalanche Photodetectors Driven by Lightning-rod Effect and  Surface Plasmon Excitations,"Abstract: Sensitive avalanche photodetectors (APDs) that operate within the ultravioletspectrum are critically required for applications in detecting fire anddeep-space exploration. However, the development of such devices facessignificant challenges, including high avalanche breakdown voltage, thenecessity for complex quenching circuits, and thermal runaway associated withGeiger-mode avalanche operation. To mitigate these issues, we report on a4H-SiC APD design utilizing micro-holes (MHs) structures and Al nano-triangles(NTs) to enhance surface electric field driven by strong localized surfaceplasmon excitations and lightning-rod effect. The device demonstrates a recordlow avalanche breakdown voltage of approximately 14.5 V, a high detectivity of7E13 Jones, a nanosecond-level response time, and repeated stable detectionswithout the requirement of a quenching circuit. Collectively, when comparedwith the conventional wide-bandgap-based APDs, this device achieves a reductionin avalanche breakdown voltage by an order of magnitude and exhibits asubstantial increase in detectivity. Consequently, the proposed APDconfiguration presents a promising candidate for ultraviolet detection andintegrated optoelectronic circuits.",12/2/2024,"['photodetectors', 'avalanche', 'lightning', 'optoelectronic', 'ultravioletspectrum']"

In addition, different types of active stabilization techniquesbased on higher-order modes, are then implemented and characterized based ontheir performance. We achieved a stability of about 0.5 pm RMS, while the errorphotons leaking from the continuous locking beam to a fluorescence detector aresuppressed by more than 100-fold.

Simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance measurements based on  laser triangulation,"Abstract: Laser triangulation sensors are widely used in industry for surfaceinspection due to simple setup, micron precision and low cost.

For overcoming these issues, based on the geometric optics wepropose novel theoretical models and methods to achieve lateral velocitymeasurement. Moreover, a novel axial distance measurement method using edgedetection is presented, which can increase the lateral resolution by the orderof one magnitude. The performance of the proposed methods are validated throughsimultaneous orthogonal velocity and distance measurements on a movingestablished metal specimen, showing the relative error and relative uncertaintycan reach 10^{-4}. The versatility of this multi degree of freedom measurementmethod paves the way for its broad application across all laser triangulationsystems.

Towards a new generation of solid total-energy detectors for  neutron-capture time-of-flight experiments with intense neutron beams,"Abstract: Challenging neutron-capture cross-section measurements of small crosssections and samples with a very limited number of atoms require high-fluxtime-of-flight facilities. In turn, such facilities need innovative detectionsetups that are fast, have low sensitivity to neutrons, can quickly recoverfrom the so-called $\gamma$-flash, and offer the highest possible detectionsensitivity. In this paper, we present several steps toward such advancedsystems. Specifically, we describe the performance of a high-sensitivityexperimental setup at CERN n\_TOF EAR2. It consists of nine sTED detectormodules in a compact cylindrical configuration, two conventional usedlarge-volume C$_{6}$D$_{6}$ detectors, and one LaCl$_{3}$(Ce) detector. Theperformance of these detection systems is compared using$^{93}$Nb($n$,$\gamma$) data. We also developed a detailed \textsc{Geant4}Monte Carlo model of the experimental EAR2 setup, which allows for a betterunderstanding of the detector features, including their efficiencydetermination. This Monte Carlo model has been used for further optimization,thus leading to a new conceptual design of a $\gamma$ detector array, STAR,based on a deuterated-stilbene crystal array. Finally, the suitability ofdeuterated-stilbene crystals for the future STAR array is investigagedexperimentally utilizing a small stilbene-d12 prototype.

Noninvasive In vivo Estimation of HbA1c Based on Beer Lambert Model from  Photoplethysmogram Using Only Two Wavelengths,"Abstract: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the most important factor in diabetes control.Since HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding threemonths, it is unaffected by the patient's activity level or diet before thetest. Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complicationsassociated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography ishelpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths(615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two differentratio calibrations were applied and performances were compared to a work thatuses three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson r values for HbA1cestimates are 0.896 and 0.905 considering ratio calibrations for blood vesseland whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibrationin addition to ratio calibrations, we can improve this performance, such thatthe Pearson r values of HbA1c levels are 0.929 and 0.930 for blood vessel andwhole finger models, respectively. In the previous study using threewavelengths, the Pearson r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood-vessel andwhole-finger models, respectively. Here, the RCF of SpO2 estimation is 0.986when SpO2 ratio calibration is applied, while in the previous study, the RCFvalues of SpO2 estimation were 0.983 and 0.986 for the blood-vessel and wholefinger models, respectively. Thus, we show that HbA1c estimation using only twowavelengths has comparable performance to previous studies.",12/4/2024,"['diabetes', 'glucose', 'hemoglobin', 'diet', 'threewavelengths']"

Assessing the performance of CT image denoisers using Laguerre-Gauss  Channelized Hotelling Observer for lesion detection,"Abstract: The remarkable success of deep learning methods in solving computer visionproblems, such as image classification, object detection, scene understanding,image segmentation, etc., has paved the way for their application in biomedicalimaging. One such application is in the field of CT image denoising, wherebydeep learning methods are proposed to recover denoised images from noisy imagesacquired at low radiation. Outputs derived from applying deep learningdenoising algorithms may appear clean and visually pleasing; however, theunderlying diagnostic image quality may not be on par with their normal-dose CTcounterparts. In this work, we assessed the image quality of deep learningdenoising algorithms by making use of visual perception- and datafidelity-based task-agnostic metrics (like the PSNR and the SSIM) - commonlyused in the computer vision - and a task-based detectability assessment (theLCD) - extensively used in the CT imaging. When compared against normal-dose CTimages, the deep learning denoisers outperformed low-dose CT based on metricslike the PSNR (by 2.4 to 3.8 dB) and SSIM (by 0.05 to 0.11). However, based onthe LCD performance, the detectability using quarter-dose denoised outputs wasinferior to that obtained using normal-dose CT scans.",12/4/2024,"['biomedicalimaging', 'visionproblems', 'diagnostic', 'algorithms', 'learningdenoising']"
High-Quality Passive Acoustic Mapping with the Cross-Correlated Angular  Spectrum Method,"Abstract: While passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been advanced for monitoringacoustic cavitation activity in focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy, achievingboth real-time and high-quality imaging capabilities is still challenging. Theangular spectrum (AS) method presents the most efficient algorithm for PAM, butit suffers from artifacts and low resolution due to the diffraction pattern ofthe imaging array. Data-adaptive beamformers suppress artifacts well, but theiroverwhelming computational complexity, more than two orders of magnitude higherthan the classical time exposure acoustic (TEA) method, hinders theirapplication in real-time. In this work, we introduce the cross-correlated ASmethod to address the challenge. This method is based on cross-correlating theAS back-propagated wave fields, in the frequency domain, measured by differentapodized sub-apertures of the transducer array to provide the normalizedcorrelation coefficient (NCC) matrix for artifacts suppression. We observedthat the spatial pattern of NCC matrix is variable which can be utilized by thetriple apodization with cross-correlation (TAX) with AS scheme, namely theAS-TAX method, for optimal artifacts suppression outcomes. Both the phantom andmouse tumor experiments showed that: 1) the AS-TAX method has comparable imagequality as the data-adaptive beamformers, reducing the energy spread area by34.8-66.6% and improving image signal-to-noise ratio by 10.7-14.5 dB comparedto TEA; 2) it reduces the computational complexity by two orders of magnitudecompared to TEA allowing millisecond-level image reconstruction speed with aparallel implementation; 3) it can well map microbubble cavitation activity ofdifferent status (stable or inertial). The AS-TAX method represents a real-timeapproach to monitor cavitation-based FUS therapy with high image quality.",12/3/2024,"['tumor', 'challenging', 'suffers', 'ultrasound', 'therapy']"
Learning a Filtered Backprojection Reconstruction Method for  Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with Hemispherical Measurement Geometries,"Abstract: In certain three-dimensional (3D) applications of photoacoustic computedtomography (PACT), including \textit{in vivo} breast imaging, hemisphericalmeasurement apertures that enclose the object within their convex hull areemployed for data acquisition. Data acquired with such measurement geometriesare referred to as \textit{half-scan} data, as only half of a completespherical measurement aperture is employed. Although previous studies havedemonstrated that half-scan data can uniquely and stably reconstruct thesought-after object, no closed-form reconstruction formula for use withhalf-scan data has been reported. To address this, a semi-analyticreconstruction method in the form of filtered backprojection (FBP), referred toas the half-scan FBP method, is developed in this work. Because the explicitform of the filtering operation in the half-scan FBP method is not currentlyknown, a learning-based method is proposed to approximate it. The proposedmethod is systematically investigated by use of virtual imaging studies of 3Dbreast PACT that employ ensembles of numerical breast phantoms and aphysics-based model of the data acquisition process. The method is subsequentlyapplied to experimental data acquired in an \textit{in vivo} breast PACT study.The results confirm that the half-scan FBP method can accurately reconstruct 3Dimages from half-scan data. Importantly, because the sought-after inversemapping is well-posed, the reconstruction method remains accurate even whenapplied to data that differ considerably from those employed to learn thefiltering operation.",12/2/2024,"['3dimages', '3dbreast', 'computedtomography', 'hemisphericalmeasurement', 'photoacoustic']"
On a revised concept of an event that allows linking microdosimetry in  nanometric sites and nanodosimetry with macroscopic dosimetry,"Abstract: Microdosimetry and nanodosimetry study the track structure of chargedparticles, i.e., the stochastics of radiation interaction on the microscopicscale. The (different) concepts developed in micro- and nanodosimetry arematched to the experimental approaches in the two fields. This work reviews theconcepts of an event used in the two fields and explores a common denominatorbetween the two methodologies to characterize particle track structure at thenanometric level. An approach to harmonize the concepts of microdosimetry andnanodosimetry for nanometric sites and linking them to macroscopic fluence istheoretically formulated and tested on proton tracks with energies between 1MeV and 100 MeV. Unification of microdosimetry and nanodosimetry for the sametarget seems to require three elements: (1) the definition of an event asrelating to a beam volume within which interactions of the primary particle canresult in energy deposits or ionizations in the site, (2) the definition of ananodosimetric analogue to a microdosimetric event, and (3) the redefinition ofthe microdosimetric concept of an event to include only events in which anionization occurs in the site. The range of impact parameters of particletracks that contributes to energy imparted in a site appears not to depend onwhether any energy deposits or only energy deposits by ionizations areconsidered. Since there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between trackspassing a site and the occurrence of an event, it is proposed to use thefluence for which on average one event occurs as a substitute for singleevents.",12/1/2024,"['nanodosimetry', 'nanometric', 'microdosimetry', 'particletracks', 'microscopicscale']"
Wireless Electronic-free Mechanical Metamaterial Implants,"Abstract: Despite significant advancements in wireless smart implants over the last twodecades, current implantable devices still operate passively and requireadditional electronic modules for wireless transmission of the storedbiological data. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative wirelessforce sensing paradigm for implantable systems through the integration ofmechanical metamaterials and nano energy harvesting technologies. Wedemonstrate composite mechanical metamaterial implants capable of serving asall-in-one wireless force sensing units, incorporating functions for powergeneration, sensing and transmission with ultra-low power requirements. In thisalternative communication approach, the electrical signals harvested by theimplants from mechanical stimuli are utilized directly for the wirelesstransmission of the sensed data. We conduct experimental and theoreticalstudies to demonstrate the wireless detection of the generated strain-inducedpolarization electric field using electrodes. The feasibility of the proposedwireless force sensing approach is evaluated through a proof-of-conceptorthopedic implant in the form of a total knee replacement. The findingsindicate that the created wireless, electronic-free metamaterial implants witha power output as low as 0.1 picowatts enable direct, self-powered wirelesscommunication during force sensing across air, simulated body fluid and animaltissue. We validate the functionality of the proposed implants through a seriesof experiments conducted on an ex vivo human cadaver knee specimen.Furthermore, the effect of electrode size and placement on the strength of thereceived signals is examined. Finally, we highlight the potential of ourapproach to create a diverse array of mechanically-tunable wireless forcesensing implants without relying on any external power sources.",12/1/2024,"['wirelesscommunication', 'wirelesstransmission', 'wirelessforce', 'wireless', 'storedbiological']"
Deep Learning for Longitudinal Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation in  MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer,"Abstract: Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effectiveMRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. However,manual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming andprone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential toovercome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, ourteam, $\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy(pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volumesegmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinalGTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet withdeep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset ofpre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dicesimilarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to modelstrained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-awareattention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate featureslearned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slightimprovements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI withpre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10pre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 forprimary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1. ForTask 2, the ensemble of 10 mid-RT segmentation models attained an averageDSCagg of 0.733, with 0.607 for GTVp and 0.859 for GTVn, leading us to$\textbf{achieve 1st place}$. In summary, we presented a collection of DLmodels that could facilitate GTV segmentation in MRgART, offering the potentialto streamline radiation oncology workflows.

Artifact Correction in Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging for Laser  Interstitial Thermotherapy with Multi-echo Acquisitions,"Abstract: In MRI-guided laser interstitial thermotherapy (MRgLITT), a signal voidsometimes appears at the heating center of the measured temperature map. Inneurosurgical MRgLITT treatments, cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (CSF), whichmay lead to temperature artifacts, also needs to be carefully managed. We findthat signal loss in MR magnitude images can be one distinct contributor to thetemperature imaging signal void. Therefore, this study aims to investigate thisfinding and more importantly. Also, this study intends to improve measurementaccuracy by correcting CSF-induced temperature errors and employing a morereliable phase unwrapping algorithm. A gradient echo sequence with certain TEvalues for temperature imaging is used to quantify T2* variations duringMRgLITT and to investigate the development of signal voids throughout thetreatment. Informed by these findings, a multi-echo GRE sequence withappropriate TE coverage is employed. A multi-echo-based correction algorithm isdeveloped to address the signal loss-induced temperature errors. A new phaseunwrapping method and a new CSF pulsation correction approach are developed formulti-echo signal processing. The temperature imaging method is evaluated bygel phantom, ex-vivo, and in-vivo LITT heating experiments. T2* shorteningduring heating can be one important cause of the temperate imaging signal voidsand this demands the multi-echo acquisition with varied TE values. The proposedmulti-echo-based method can effectively correct signal loss-induced temperatureerrors and raise temperature estimation precision. The multi-echo thermometryin the in-vivo experiments shows smoother hotspot boundaries, fewer artifacts,and improved thermometry reliability. In the in-vivo experiments, the ablationareas estimated from the multi-echo thermometry also show satisfactoryagreement with those determined from post-ablation MR imaging.",11/29/2024,"['mri', 'thermotherapy', 'thermometryin', 'thermometry', 'laser']"
Influencing Factors of the FLASH Effect: Unveiling the Importance of  Free Radicals,"Abstract: Purpose: Our aim was to elucidate the critical factors responsible forinducing the FLASH effect, focusing on the role of free radicals throughsimulation and experimental approaches. Methods and Materials: The wholeabdomen of C57BL/6 mice was irradiated with 6 MeV electron beam. The endpointwas acute intestinal toxicity quantified by histological score. Total dosesranging from 6 to 15 Gy were evaluated. The impact of the mean dose rate (MDR)was assessed in the range of 40 to 900 Gy/s. Dose per pulse (DPP) of 0.5 Gy and3 Gy were compared. The recombination of peroxyl radicals were simulated.Further comparisons were conducted by incorporating the antioxidant amifostine.Results: When varying total doses with a constant MDR of 900 Gy/s, the FLASHeffect was not observed until the dose reached 15 Gy. For a total dose of 15 Gyand varying MDR, the FLASH effect was observed only when MDR reached 100 Gy/s.For a dose of 15 Gy and an MDR of 150 Gy/s, no significant difference inbiological effect was observed between low DPP and high DPP. The simulationresults indicated that the fraction of peroxyl radicals recombination remainednearly zero at conventional dose rates. For FLASH irradiation, therecombination fraction increased linearly with the dose. Notably, the dosedelivery time corresponding to 50% change in the recombination fraction wasapproximately 300 ms. The addition of amifostine effectively eliminated thedifference between FLASH group and CONV group. Conclusions: The criticalrequirement for observing the sparing effect at the biological endpoint is theadministration of an adequate dose within the time window of the radicalreaction. Additionally, the important role of free radical was verified afterintroducing antioxidants, suggesting that the generation and recombination offree radicals are pivotal factors influencing the FLASH sparing effect.",11/28/2024,"['radicalreaction', 'radicals', 'recombination', 'flasheffect', 'criticalrequirement']"
Multi-Task Learning for Integrated Automated Contouring and Voxel-Based  Dose Prediction in Radiotherapy,"Abstract: Deep learning-based automated contouring and treatment planning has beenproven to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiotherapy. However,conventional radiotherapy treatment planning process has the automatedcontouring and treatment planning as separate tasks. Moreover in deep learning(DL), the contouring and dose prediction tasks for automated treatment planningare done independently. In this study, we applied the multi-task learning (MTL)approach in order to seamlessly integrate automated contouring and voxel-baseddose prediction tasks, as MTL can leverage common information between the twotasks and be able able to increase the efficiency of the automated tasks. Wedeveloped our MTL framework using the two datasets: in-house prostate cancerdataset and the publicly available head and neck cancer dataset, OpenKBP.Compared to the sequential DL contouring and treatment planning tasks, ourproposed method using MTL improved the mean absolute difference of dose volumehistogram metrics of prostate and head and neck sites by 19.82% and 16.33%,respectively. Our MTL model for automated contouring and dose prediction tasksdemonstrated enhanced dose prediction performance while maintaining orsometimes even improving the contouring accuracy. Compared to the baselineautomated contouring model with the dice score coefficients of 0.818 forprostate and 0.674 for head and neck datasets, our MTL approach achievedaverage scores of 0.824 and 0.716 for these datasets, respectively. Our studyhighlights the potential of the proposed automated contouring and planningusing MTL to support the development of efficient and accurate automatedtreatment planning for radiotherapy.",11/27/2024,"['radiotherapy', 'automatedcontouring', 'cancerdataset', 'automatedtreatment', 'studyhighlights']"
MRI Breast tissue segmentation using nnU-Net for biomechanical modeling,"Abstract: Integrating 2D mammography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) iscrucial for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However,this integration is challenging due to differences in imaging modalities andthe need for precise tissue segmentation and alignment. This paper addressesthese challenges by enhancing biomechanical breast models in two main aspects:improving tissue identification using nnU-Net segmentation models andevaluating finite element (FE) biomechanical solvers, specifically comparingNiftySim and FEBio. We performed a detailed six-class segmentation of breastMRI data using the nnU-Net architecture, achieving Dice Coefficients of 0.94for fat, 0.88 for glandular tissue, and 0.87 for pectoral muscle. The overallforeground segmentation reached a mean Dice Coefficient of 0.83 through anensemble of 2D and 3D U-Net configurations, providing a solid foundation for 3Dreconstruction and biomechanical modeling. The segmented data was then used togenerate detailed 3D meshes and develop biomechanical models using NiftySim andFEBio, which simulate breast tissue's physical behaviors under compression. Ourresults include a comparison between NiftySim and FEBio, providing insightsinto the accuracy and reliability of these simulations in studying breasttissue responses under compression. The findings of this study have thepotential to improve the integration of 2D and 3D imaging modalities, therebyenhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for breast cancer.",11/27/2024,"['cancer', 'mri', 'biomechanical', '3dreconstruction', 'breasttissue']"
Nonlinear unitary circuits for photonic neural networks,"Abstract: Photonics has unlocked the potential for energy-efficient acceleration ofdeep learning. Most approaches toward photonic deep learning have diligentlyreproduced traditional deep learning architectures using photonic platforms,separately implementing linear-optical matrix calculations and nonlinearactivations via electro-optical conversion, optical nonlinearities, andsignal-encoded materials. Here we propose a concept of nonlinear unitaryphotonic circuits to achieve the integration of linear and nonlinearexpressivity essential for deep neural networks. We devise a building block fortwo-dimensional nonlinear unitary operations, featuring norm-preservingmappings with nonconservative inner products, which enables the construction ofhigh-dimensional nonlinear unitary circuits. Using deep nonlinear unitarycircuits, we demonstrate exponential growth in trajectory length andnear-complete coverage of the output space, both of which are essential fordeep learning.

Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties,"Abstract: Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distortedview of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising,deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before theirexploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restorationcould be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoidingpropagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods arenow state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require totrain a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associateduncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single networkto restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive theuncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deepprior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimizationscheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in thelatent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating theuncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalableposterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, wepropose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficientlycomputes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set ofexperiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images,asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xzand SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversionmethods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posteriorsamples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compellingalternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is notrequired.",12/5/2024,"['satellite', 'restorationcould', 'avoidingpropagating', 'hallucination', 'efficientlycomputes']"

On-Chip Enhanced Biphoton Generation with Incoherent Light,"Abstract: On-chip quantum photon sources are pivotal components in integratedphotonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologiesover recent decades. Traditionally, the coherence of the pump beam has beenconsidered a critical property in ensuring the quality of the source. In thiswork, we produce a photon-pair source via spontaneous four-wave mixing pumpedby temporally incoherent light in a standard silicon nanowire. Compared to acoherent laser, the incoherence improves pump utilization efficiency, whichresults in higher source brightness. Additionally, its spectrally uncorrelatednature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source,allowing high-purity state preparation without the need for narrow filtering.Experimentally, we demonstrate the advantages using an amplified spontaneousemission source over a continuous-wave laser. With temporally incoherentpumping, the photon pair generation rate increases by 40%. Thecoincidence-to-accidental ratio and heralded second-order autocorrelationexhibit improved performance at low power.

Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal  Invariant Materials,"Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materialsdisplaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equationsfor traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations thatresemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regimerelevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displaysa Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back andforth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traversesthe material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree ofpolarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with theintensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuringthickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lowerfrequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materialsdisplaying the non-linear Hall effect.",12/4/2024,"['electromagnetic', 'radiation', 'boltzmann', 'equations', 'faraday']"

By carefully analyzing the different processesinvolved, we show that a virtuous interplay between Raman scattering and azero-nonlinearity wavelength is a key enabler for soliton generation to occur,limiting the initial soliton redshift and allowing for an efficient energytransfer between the dispersive pulse and its reflection.

Light structuring via nonlinear total angular momentum addition with  flat optics,"Abstract: Shaping the structure of light with flat optical devices has drivensignificant advancements in our fundamental understanding of light andlight-matter interactions, and enabled a broad range of applications, fromimage processing and microscopy to optical communication, quantum informationprocessing, and the manipulation of microparticles. Yet, pushing the boundariesof structured light beyond the linear optical regime remains an open challenge.Nonlinear optical interactions, such as wave mixing in nonlinear flat optics,offer a powerful platform to unlock new degrees of freedom and functionalitiesfor generating and detecting structured light. In this study, we experimentallydemonstrate the non-trivial structuring of third-harmonic light enabled by theaddition of total angular momentum projection in a nonlinear, isotropic flatoptics element -- a single thin film of amorphous silicon. We identify thetotal angular momentum projection and helicity as the most critical propertiesfor analyzing the experimental results. The theoretical model we propose,supported by numerical simulations, offers quantitative predictions for lightstructuring through nonlinear wave mixing under various pumping conditions,including vectorial and non-paraxial pump light.

Ultrabroadband Resonant Frequency Doubling on a Chip,"Abstract: Microresonators are powerful tools to enhance the efficiency of second-ordernonlinear optical processes, such as second-harmonic generation, which cancoherently bridge octave-spaced spectral bands. However, dispersion constraintssuch as phase-matching and doubly resonant conditions have so far limiteddemonstrations to narrowband operation. In this work, we overcome theselimitations showing ultrabroadband resonant frequency doubling in a novelintegrated device, wherein the resonant enhancement of pump and second harmonicare individually addressed in two distinct and linearly uncoupled microringresonators, each adjusted to target the respective spectral band. The twomicroresonators are designed and tuned independently, yet share a commoninteraction region that grants nonlinear coupling over a quasi-phase-matchingbandwidth exceeding 200 nm, enabled by the inscription of a photoinduced$\chi^{(2)}$ grating. The system allows to not only conveniently disentanglethe design parameters of the two microresonators but also to reconfigure thedoubly resonant condition electrically, and the phase-matching conditionoptically. We demonstrate milliwatt-level addressable second-harmonicgeneration over the entire telecom band and then configure the device togenerate and upconvert a Kerr frequency comb with bandwidth exceeding 100 nmand upconverted power up to 10 mW.",12/4/2024,"['microringresonators', 'harmonicgeneration', 'ultrabroadband', 'novelintegrated', 'reconfigure']"
Uncovering Hidden Variables: A Physics Classroom Activity on Correlation  and Causation,"Abstract: One of the main goals of physics education is to develop in students theability to think critically about data and scientific models. This skill is keyin everyday life, as it allows one to interpret data accurately, evaluatewhether conclusions are based on evidence, and distinguish between meaningfulpatterns and random occurrences. Although ""correlation does not implycausation"" it is common to make mistakes when interpreting relationshipsbetween variables, either due to bias or the human tendency to seek causalexplanations. The history of science is filled with examples where causalitywas incorrectly inferred from correlation. In today's society, with the rise offake news, misinterpretation, and data manipulation, educating students aboutscientific reasoning is more important than ever. In this paper, we present anactivity aimed at high school physics students as part of an introductorymodule on scientific work. The learning objectives of this activity are toadequately plot a set of data, to extract relevant information from these data,and to clearly distinguish between correlation and causation.

Scaffold or Crutch? Examining College Students' Use and Views of  Generative AI Tools for STEM Education,"Abstract: Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology,Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priorityinto effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment remaina significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificialintelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces newconsiderations about how these tools can help or hinder students' developmentof STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerationsby studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEMcoursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEMcollege students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty tounderstand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance inSTEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applicationsof genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases include findingexplanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping withproblem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to savetime. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputtingproblems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their ownproblem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoptionrates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall shortin enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study alsoexplored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risksassociated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provideinsights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM coursesand how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solvingcompetency.",12/3/2024,"['mathematics', 'newconsiderations', 'stemcoursework', 'faculty', 'stemcollege']"

Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through  new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation,"Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due tothe advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into uppersecondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. Thiscontribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology coursefor upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launchedduring the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The courseaimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics whilehighlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonianmechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learningmaterials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, whilesystematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the uppersecondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an activelearning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engagingapplications related to current research, reflective exercises, thoughtexperiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explorewhether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology coursecould be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students.A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes,including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance ofscience. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, withlarge to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles.Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed.We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondaryphysics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging,comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.",12/2/2024,"['physics', 'cosmology', 'newtonianmechanics', 'mathematical', 'teaching']"
Can ChatGPT pass a physics degree? Making a case for reformation of  assessment of undergraduate degrees,"Abstract: The emergence of conversational natural language processing models presents asignificant challenge for Higher Education. In this work, we use the entiretyof a UK physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including allexaminations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. Weadopt a ""maximal cheating"" approach wherein we permit ourselves to modifyquestions for clarity, split questions up into smaller sub-components, expandon answers given - especially for long form written responses, obtainingreferences, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions tooptimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree inquestion where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratoryelements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were noissue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. Ingeneral, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simplesingle-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose aregenerally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggestthat there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessmentpractice in physics - and other disciplines - due to the existence of AI suchas GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilatedin-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or ""performances"" inother disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urgeconsideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.",12/2/2024,"['physics', 'undergraduate', 'laboratoryelements', 'laboratory', 'class']"

Inferring Leader-Follower Behavior from Presence Data in the Marine  Environment: A Case Study on Reef Manta Rays,"Abstract: Social interactions are fundamental in animal groups, including humans, andcan take various forms, such as competition, cooperation, or kinship.Understanding these interactions in marine environments has been historicallychallenging due to data collection difficulties. However, advancements inacoustic telemetry now enable remote analysis of such behaviors. This studyproposes a method to derive leader-follower networks from presence datacollected by a single acoustic receiver at a specific location.Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, the method analyzes lag times betweenconsecutive presences of individuals to infer directed relationships. Tested onsimulated data, it was then applied to detection data from acoustically taggedreef manta rays (\textit{Mobula~alfredi}) frequenting a known site. Resultsrevealed temporal patterns, including circadian rhythms and burst-like behaviorwith power-law distributed time gaps between presences.The inferred leader-follower network highlighted key behavioral patterns:females followed males more often than expected, males showed stronger butfewer associations with specific females, and smaller individuals followedothers less consistently than larger ones. These findings align with ecologicalinsights, revealing structured social interactions and providing a novelframework for studying marine animal behavior through network theory.",12/5/2024,"['ecologicalinsights', 'telemetry', 'historicallychallenging', 'studyproposes', 'novelframework']"
Synthetic graphs for link prediction benchmarking,"Abstract: Predicting missing links in complex networks requires algorithms that areable to explore statistical regularities in the existing data. Here weinvestigate the interplay between algorithm efficiency and network structuresthrough the introduction of suitably-designed synthetic graphs. We propose afamily of random graphs that incorporates both micro-scale motifs andmeso-scale communities, two ubiquitous structures in complex networks. A keycontribution is the derivation of theoretical upper bounds for link predictionperformance in our synthetic graphs, allowing us to estimate the predictabilityof the task and obtain an improved assessment of the performance of any method.Our results on the performance of classical methods (e.g., Stochastic BlockModels, Node2Vec,GraphSage) show that the performance of all methods correlatewith the theoretical predictability, that no single method is universallysuperior, and that each of the methods exploit different characteristics knownto exist in large classes of networks. Our findings underline the need forcareful consideration of graph structure when selecting a link predictionmethod and emphasize the value of comparing performance against syntheticbenchmarks. We provide open-source code for generating these synthetic graphs,enabling further research on link prediction methods.",12/4/2024,"['algorithms', 'syntheticbenchmarks', 'graphs', 'graphsage', 'algorithm']"
Scaling and universality for percolation in random networks: A unified  view,"Abstract: Percolation processes on random networks have been the subject of intenseresearch activity over the last decades: the overall phenomenology of standardpercolation on uncorrelated and unclustered topologies is well known. Stillsome critical properties of the transition, in particular for heterogeneoussubstrates, have not been fully elucidated and contradictory results appear inthe literature. In this paper we present, by means of a generating functionsapproach, a thorough and complete investigation of percolation criticalproperties in random networks. We determine all critical exponents, theassociated critical amplitude ratios and the form of the cluster sizedistribution for networks of any level of heterogeneity. We uncover, inparticular for highly heterogeneous networks, subtle crossover phenomena,nontrivial scaling forms and violations of hyperscaling. In this way we clarifythe origin of inconsistencies in the previous literature.",8/9/2024,"['decades', 'heterogeneoussubstrates', 'intenseresearch', 'topologies', 'standardpercolation']"
Relations of society concepts and religions from Wikipedia networks,"Abstract: We analyze the Google matrix of directed networks of Wikipedia articlesrelated to 8 recent Wikipedia language editions representing different cultures(English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese). Usingthe reduced Google matrix algorithm we determine relations and interactions of23 society concepts and 17 religions represented by their respective articlesfor each of the 8 editions. The effective Markov transitions are found to bemore intense inside the two blocks of society concepts and religions whiletransitions between the blocks are significantly reduced. We establish 5 polesof influence for society concepts (Law, Society, Communism, Liberalism,Capitalism) as well as 5 poles for religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism,Hinduism, Chinese folk religion) and determine how they affect other entries.We compute inter edition correlations for different key quantities providing aquantitative analysis of the differences or the proximity of views of the 8cultures with respect to the selected society concepts and religions.",12/4/2024,"['wikipedia', 'google', 'italian', '8cultures', 'liberalism']"
Economic Hubs and the Domination of Inter-Regional Ties in World City  Networks,"Abstract: Cities are widely considered the lifeblood of a nations economy housing thebulk of industries, commercial and trade activities, and employmentopportunities. Within this economic context, multinational corporations play animportant role in this economic development of cities in particular, andsubsequently the countries and regions they belong to, in general. Asmultinational companies are spread throughout the world by virtue ofownership-subsidiary relationship, these ties create complex inter-dependentnetworks of cities that shape and define socio-economic status, as well asmacro-regional influences impacting the world economy.In this paper, we study these networks of cities formed as a result of tiesbetween multinational firms. We analyze these networks using intra-regional,inter-regional and hybrid ties (conglomerate integration) as spatial motifsdefined by geographic delineation of world's economic regions. We attempt tounderstand how global cities position themselves in spatial and economicgeographies and how their ties promote regional integration along with globalexpansion for sustainable growth and economic development. We study thesenetworks over four time periods from 2010 to 2019 and discover interestingtrends and patterns. The most significant result is the domination ofinter-regional motifs representing cross regional ties among cities rather thannational and regional integration.",12/3/2024,"['corporations', 'economicgeographies', 'multinational', 'global', 'globalexpansion']"
A Dissipativity Approach to Analyzing Composite Spreading Networks,"Abstract: The study of spreading processes often analyzes networks at differentresolutions, e.g., at the level of individuals or countries, but it is notalways clear how properties at one resolution can carry over to another.Accordingly, in this work we use dissipativity theory from control systemanalysis to characterize composite spreading networks that are comprised bymany interacting subnetworks. We first develop a method to represent spreadingnetworks that have inputs and outputs. Then we define a composition operationfor composing multiple spreading networks into a larger composite spreadingnetwork. Next, we develop storage and supply rate functions that can be used todemonstrate that spreading dynamics are dissipative. We then derive conditionsunder which a composite spreading network will converge to a disease-freeequilibrium as long as its constituent spreading networks are dissipative withrespect to those storage and supply rate functions. To illustrate theseresults, we use simulations of an influenza outbreak in a primary school, andwe show that an outbreak can be prevented by decreasing the average interactiontime between any pair of classes to less than 79% of the original interactiontime.",12/3/2024,"['spreadingnetworks', 'spreadingnetwork', 'differentresolutions', 'simulations', 'systemanalysis']"
Structural robustness of networks with degree-degree correlations  between second-nearest neighbors,"Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness of networks with degree-degreecorrelations between nodes separated by distance $l=2$ in terms of shortestpath length. The degree-degree correlation between the $l$-th nearest neighborscan be quantified by Pearson's correlation coefficient $r_l$ for the degrees oftwo nodes at distance $l$. We introduce $l$-th nearest-neighbor correlatedrandom networks ($l$-NNCRNs) that are degree-degree correlated at less than orequal to the $l$-th nearest neighbor scale and maximally random at fartherscales. We generate $2$-NNCRNs with various $r_1$ and $r_2$ using two steps ofrandom edge rewiring based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and comparetheir robustness against failures of nodes and edges. As typical cases ofhomogeneous and heterogeneous degree distributions, we adopted Poisson andpower law distributions. Our results show that the range of $r_2$ differsdepending on the degree distribution and the value of $r_1$. Moreover,comparing $2$-NNCRNs sharing the same degree distribution and $r_1$, wedemonstrate that a higher $r_2$ makes a network more robust against randomnode/edge failures as well as degree-based targeted attacks, regardless ofwhether $r_1$ is positive or negative.",12/3/2024,"['algorithm', 'numerically', 'degreecorrelations', 'r_2', 'comparetheir']"
Lessons learned from establishing a rooftop photovoltaic system  crowdsourced by students and employees at Aarhus University,"Abstract: Energy communities are promoted in the European legislation as a strategy toenable citizen participation in the energy transition. Solar photovoltaic (PV)systems, due to their distributed nature, present an opportunity to create suchcommunities. At Aarhus University (Denmark), we have established an energycommunity consisting of a 98-kW rooftop solar PV installation, crowdsourced bystudents and employees of the university. The participants can buy one orseveral shares of the installation (which is divided into 900 shares), theelectricity is consumed by the university, and the shareowners receive someeconomic compensation every year. The road to establishing this energycommunity has been rough, and we have gathered many learnings. In thismanuscript, we present the 10 largest challenges which might arise when settingup a university energy community and our particular approach to facing them.Sharing these learnings might pave the way for those willing to establish theirown energy community. We also include policy recommendations at a European,national, and municipality levels to facilitate the deployment of energycommunities",12/3/2024,"['photovoltaic', 'energycommunities', 'energycommunity', 'denmark', 'shareowners']"

Quantum Decision Theory,"Abstract: In this article, we propose to use the formalism of quantum mechanics todescribe and explain the so-called ""abnormal"" behaviour of agents in certaindecision or choice contexts. The basic idea is to postulate that thepreferences of these agents are indeterminate (in the quantum sense of theterm) before the choice is made or the decision is taken. An agent's statebefore the decision is represented by a superposition of potential preferences.The decision is assimilated to a measure of the agent's state and leads to aprojection of the state onto one of the particular preferences. We thereforeconsider that uncertainty about preferences is not linked to incompleteinformation but to essential indeterminacy. We explore the consequences ofthese hypotheses on the usual concepts of decision theory and apply theformalism to the problem of the so-called ""framing"" effect.",11/22/2024,"['quantum', 'hypotheses', 'mechanics', 'incompleteinformation', 'theory']"
Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals reveals signatures of  seizure susceptibility,"Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictalperiods). However, whether epilepsy may alter brain dynamics during background(non-ictal) periods is less understood. To investigate this, we analyzed thebrain activity of epileptic zebrafish as animal models, for two geneticconditions and two fishlines. The recordings were automatically segmented andlabeled with machine learning, and then analyzed using Persistent Homology, amethod from Topological Data Analysis, which reveals patterns in the topologyof brain dynamics in a noise-robust and networkbased manner. We find that ictaland non-ictal periods can be distinguished from the topology of their dynamics,regardless of fishline or genetic condition, which validates our method.Additionally, within a single fishline wild type, we can distinguish thenon-ictal periods of seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. This suggeststhe presence of topological signatures of the epileptic brain, even duringnon-ictal periods. In general, our results suggest that Topological DataAnalysis can be used as a general quantitative method to screen for dynamicalmarkers of seizure susceptibility also in other species.",12/2/2024,"['seizures', 'zebrafish', 'epilepsy', 'geneticconditions', 'epileptic']"
The connection between non-normality and trophic coherence in directed  graphs,"Abstract: Trophic coherence and non-normality are both ways of describing the overalldirectionality of directed graphs, or networks. Trophic coherence can beregarded as a measure of how neatly a graph can be divided into distinctlayers, whereas non-normality is a measure of how unlike a matrix is with itstranspose. We explore the relationship between trophic coherence andnon-normality by first considering the connections that exist in the literatureand calculating the trophic coherence and non-normality for some toy networks.We then explore how persistence of an epidemic in an SIS model depends oncoherence, and how this relates to the non-normality. A similar effect ondynamics governed by a linear operator suggests that it may be useful to extendthe concept of trophic coherence to matrices which do not necessarily representgraphs.",11/27/2024,"['graphs', 'graph', 'ondynamics', 'overalldirectionality', 'networks']"

The Role of Social Interactions in Mitigating Psychological Distress  During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study in Sri Lanka,"Abstract: Massive changes in many aspects related to social groups of differentsocioeconomic backgrounds were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result,the overall state of mental health was severely affected globally. This studyexamined how the pandemic affected Sri Lankan citizens representing a range ofsocioeconomic backgrounds in terms of their mental health. The data used inthis research was gathered from 3020 households encompassing 12,000 peopleusing a nationwide face-to-face survey. Four distinct factors were identifiedby factor analysis (FA) that was conducted and subsequently, the population wasclustered using unsupervised clustering to determine which socioeconomiccategories were affected similarly. Two population subgroups were thusidentified, their respective relationships to the retrieved components andtheir demographics were thoroughly examined and interpreted. This resulted inthe identification of contrasting perspectives between the two groups towardsthe maintenance and the state of social relationships during the pandemic,which revealed that one group were more 'outgoing' in nature resulting in theirmental state being comparatively better in coping with the pandemic. The othergroup was seen to be more 'reserved' showing an opposite reaction towardssocial connections while their mental well-being declined showing symptoms suchas loneliness, and emptiness.",11/21/2024,"['pandemic', 'socioeconomiccategories', 'massive', 'studyexamined', 'severely']"
On unipolar and bipolar HiPIMS pulse configurations to enhance energy  flux to insulating surfaces,"Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) delivers a high target powerin short pulses, enhancing the ionization and energy of sputtered atoms andproviding thus more possibilities to control the film properties. This studyexplores the effect of various pulse configurations (unipolar HiPIMS, bipolarHiPIMS, chopped unipolar, and chopped bipolar HiPIMS) to increase energy fluxto an insulated surface (e.g., substrate or growing film). The chopped bipolarHiPIMS configuration, featuring several short positive pulses replacing asingle long positive pulse, is introduced, and the total energy fluxes aresubsequently measured using a passive thermal probe. Moreover, the effect ofthe probe's capacitance with respect to the ground is systematicallyinvestigated by connecting an external capacitor. Results show that for aninsulated surface with low capacitance, bipolar pulse configurations do notsignificantly increase energy flux to the surface due to its rapid charging byplasma ions. Conversely, high surface capacitance facilitates an increase inenergy flux, as a large potential difference between the plasma and the surfaceremains even for a long positive pulse. For medium surface capacitance (tens ofnF), chopping the positive pulse in bipolar HiPIMS effectively increases theenergy delivered to the film by discharging the surface in the off-times. Thethermal probe measurements also confirm that energy to the film can beincreased for unipolar HiPIMS configurations by splitting the negative pulseinto several shorter pulses.",12/5/2024,"['ionization', 'inenergy', 'magnetron', 'plasma', 'pulseinto']"
Near-ideal relaxed MHD in slab geometry,"Abstract: We investigate the solutions of the relaxed MHD model (RxMHD) of Dewar \& Qu[J. Plasma Phys. {\bf 88}, 835880101 (2022)]. This model is a generalization ofTaylor relaxation that allows the ideal Ohm's law constraint to be included,and this offers a pathway to extend the multi-region relaxed MHD (MRxMHD)model. By constructing solutions numerically, we show that the RxMHD model ofDewar \& Qu is mathematically well-defined and computationally feasible forconstructing MHD equilibria. We also show that a cross-field flow can existwithout enforcing an arbitrary constraint on the angular momentum (as is donein the case of MRxMHD with flow), and a pressure profile with a small gradientdue to the Bernoulli flow. Our results also demonstrate the self-organizationof fully relaxed regions during the optimization, which was an importantmotivation behind developing this model.",12/5/2024,"['mathematically', '2022', 'computationally', 'optimization', 'numerically']"
Streamer discharge simulations in humid air: uncertainty in input data  and sensitivity analysis,"Abstract: We study how the choice of input data affects simulations of positivestreamers in humid air, focusing on H2O cross sections, photoionization models,and chemistry sets. Simulations are performed in air with a mole fraction of0%, 3% or 10% H2O using an axisymmetric fluid model. Five H2O cross sectionsets are considered, which lead to significant differences in the resultingelectron attachment coefficient. As a result, the streamer velocity can vary byup to about 50% with 10% H2O. We compare results with three photoionizationmodels: the Naidis model for humid air, the Aints model for humid air, and thestandard Zheleznyak model for dry air. With the Naidis and in particular theAints model, there is a significant reduction in photoionization with higherhumidities. This results in higher streamer velocities and maximal electricfields, and it can also cause streamer branching in our axisymmetricsimulations. Three humid air chemistry sets are considered. Differences betweenthese sets, particularly in the formation of water clusters around positiveions, cause the streamer velocity to vary by up to about 50% with 10% H2O. Asensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most important chemicalreactions in these chemistries.",12/5/2024,"['photoionizationmodels', 'photoionization', 'chemistry', 'chemicalreactions', 'resultingelectron']"
Validation of NSFsim as a Grad-Shafranov Equilibrium Solver at DIII-D,"Abstract: Plasma shape is a significant factor that must be considered for any FusionPilot Plant (FPP) as it has significant consequences for plasma stability andcore confinement. A new simulator, NSFsim, has been developed based on ahistorically successful code, DINA, offering tools to simulate both transportand plasma shape. Specifically, NSFsim is a free boundary equilibrium andtransport solver and has been configured to match the properties of the DIII-Dtokamak. This paper is focused on validating the Grad-Shafranov (GS) solver ofNSFsim by analyzing its ability to recreate the plasma shape, the poloidal fluxdistribution, and the measurements of the simulated diagnostic signalsoriginating from flux loops and magnetic probes in DIII-D. Five differentplasma shapes are simulated to show the robustness of NSFsim to differentplasma conditions; these shapes are Lower Single Null (LSN), Upper Single Null(USN), Double Null (DN), Inner Wall Limited (IWL), and Negative Triangularity(NT).

A Unified Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation and Radio Extreme Scattering  Events from Intermittent Interstellar Structures,"Abstract: Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explainingcosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra.Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars andpulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio,magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scatteringof radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producingESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In thispaper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce largescattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry andvolume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain theobserved mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. Themodel places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and largeaspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughoutthe Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheetmodel, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts,gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatialcorrelations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such testswill be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including CanadianHydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep SynopticArray 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).",12/4/2024,"['sheetmodel', 'explainingcosmic', 'gravitationally', 'magnetic', 'antennas']"

Unlike similar shocks in supernova remnants orrelativistic shocks in $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows, where macroscopicmagnetized layers were detected but purportedly attributed to preexisting ornon-resonant cosmic-ray streaming-seeded substructure, the upstream of strongvirial shocks is both weakly magnetized and pristine.

CT-imaging in Electrostatic Thruster Ion-Optics,"Abstract: The ion-optic grid-system is the essential part of electrostatic ionthrusters governing performance and lifetime. Therefore reliable measurementsof the grid and aperture geometry over the lifetime are necessary to understandand predict the behavior of the system. Many different methods of measurementwere introduced over the years to tackle the challenges encountered whendiagnosing single electrodes or the whole assembly at once.Modern industrial X-ray micro-computer-tomographs (uCT) offer the possibilityto obtain a three-dimensional density map of a grid-system or it's componentsdown to microscopic scales of precision. This information allows a spectrum ofnew diagnostic opportunities, like complete verification of the manufacturedparts against CAD models, detecting internal defects or density-changes or theinspection of the assembled ion-optics and its internal alignment, which isnormally prohibited by the lack of optical access to all parts at once. HenceuCT imaging is a promising tool to complement established methods and open upnew experimental possibilities, however it also has its own weaknesses andpitfalls.

Distortions in Charged-Particle Images of Laser Direct-Drive Inertial  Confinement Fusion Implosions,"Abstract: Energetic charged particles generated by inertial confinement fusion (ICF)implosions encode information about the spatial morphology of the hot-spot anddense fuel during the time of peak fusion reactions. The knock-on deuteronimager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image theseparticles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and densefuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the imagescollected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of thedeuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series ofattempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potentialmechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of chargedparticles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion.A novel particle-tracing methodology is developed and utilized to createsynthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces themain experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude with a discussionof the outlook for KoDI, and potential considerations for othercharged-particle diagnostics.",12/4/2024,"['laser', 'deuteronimager', 'deuterium', 'potentialmechanisms', 'fusion']"
Non-linear shattered pellet injection modelling in ASDEX Upgrade,"Abstract: Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigationsystem in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency andprompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear simulations of SPIin the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of differentinjection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. Thesimulations are executed as fluid simulations. Additional marker particles areused to evolve the charge state distribution of impurities based on OpenADASatomic data, i.e., no coronal equilibrium assumption is made. Regarding thepellet composition, neon fraction scans from 0 - 10% are performed. Numericalresults show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the firststage, approximately half of the thermal energy is lost abruptly, primarilythrough convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. Thisstage is relatively independent of the injection parameters. In the secondstage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiationplays a dominant role. In cases of very low neon content, this second stage maynot occur at all. A larger fraction ($\sim $20%) of the total material in thepellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets (0.12%) sincethe full thermal collapse of the plasma occurs later than in high neon fractionscenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increaseswith increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetrationspeed are further studied. Slower and smaller fragments promote edge coolingand the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQduration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regionsquicker. Using synthetic diagnostics, comparisons of general trend betweensimulations and experiments are conducted.",12/4/2024,"['mitigationsystem', 'penetrationspeed', 'openadasatomic', 'radiationplays', 'thesimulations']"

This studyexamines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), todecrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial andthree velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic,parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We comparesimulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realisticmass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings showthat the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermalenergy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to moreefficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at highermomentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electronacceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electronacceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heatingand lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly moremagnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, theelectron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reducedion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electronheating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that theion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magneticfield, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.",12/4/2024,"['electronacceleration', 'variousastrophysical', 'electronheating', 'studyexamines', 'moreefficient']"
Direct Evidence of a Highest Wave-Driven Energetic Electron Flux at the  Earth's Magnetopause,"Abstract: Spacecraft observations of high-energy electron flux enhancement up to 125keV at Earth's magnetopause are typically linked to the magnetic reconnection.Here, we report the first ever observation of prolonged electron fluxenhancement reaching very high energy up to 650 keV at magnetopause near thesubsolar point, notably without reconnection signatures. The observationreveals that the high-energy electron flux enhancement near the magnetopause isassociated with the simultaneous occurrence of electron cyclotron waveharmonics, whistler waves, and Langmuir waves. Theoretical modeling confirmsthe wave generation by electron temperature anisotropy and the electron losscone distribution. This direct, in-situ observation of high-energy electronflux linked to cascaded wave-particle interactions will help us advance ourunderstanding about the tiniest electron-scale intricacies affecting near-Earthspace weather.",12/4/2024,"['spacecraft', 'magnetopause', 'electronflux', 'waveharmonics', 'earthspace']"
Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection:  parameters in reconnection models,"Abstract: Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magneticreconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on thistopic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming acircularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gapremains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring inreal astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated theinfluence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out thedifferences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. Weintroduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of anaccretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotatingblack hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions bytreating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing thetheoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. Weemploy two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guidefield fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependencesof energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. Moreimportantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted byreconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system inextracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, underthe assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically andrandomly within the ergosphere.",12/4/2024,"['astrophysical', 'magneticreconnection', 'plasma', 'magnetic', 'rotatingblack']"
Quadrupolar Density Structures in Driven Magnetic Reconnection  Experiments with a Guide Field,"Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in plasma physics, drivingrapid and energetic events such as coronal mass ejections. Reconnection betweenmagnetic fields with arbitrary shear can be decomposed into an anti-parallel,reconnecting component, and a non-reconnecting guide-field component which isparallel to the reconnecting electric field. This guide field modifies thestructure of the reconnection layer and the reconnection rate. We presentresults from experiments on the MAIZE pulsed-power generator (500 kA peakcurrent, 200 ns rise-time) which use two exploding wire arrays, tilted inopposite directions, to embed a guide field in the plasma flows with a relativestrength $b\equiv B_g/B_{rec}=\text{0, 0.4, or 1}$. The reconnection layers inthese experiments have widths which are less than the ion skin depth,$d_i=c/\omega_{pi}$, indicating the importance of the Hall term, whichgenerates a distinctive quadrupolar magnetic field structure along theseparatrices of the reconnection layer. Using laser imaging interferometry, weobserve quadrupolar structures in the line-integrated electron density,consistent with the interaction of the embedded guide field with thequadrupolar Hall field. Our measurements extend over much larger length scales($40 d_i$) at higher $\beta$ ($\sim 1$) than previous experiments, providing aninsight into the global structure of the reconnection layer.",12/3/2024,"['physics', 'plasma', 'laser', 'interferometry', 'magnetic']"
Controlling the interaction of tightly focused 10-PW class lasers with  multicomponent plasma via target parameters: optimization of  electron-positron pair and $γ$-photon sources,"Abstract: The interaction of multipetawatt lasers with plasma is a complexmultiparameter problem, providing a wide field for fundamental research andopening up great opportunities for creating unique sources of high-energyelectrons and positrons, dense pair plasma, and $\gamma$-photons. However, toachieve high efficiency of such a source, it is necessary to use targets withoptimized parameters, primarily density and size, for the given laserparameters. With the use of 3D QED-PIC modeling it is shown that, when targetswhose size is comparable with the laser wavelength are irradiated by laserbeams with a total power of several tens of PW, the total initial number oftarget electrons may be regarded to be the similarity parameter of laser-plasmainteraction. In practice, this can significantly simplify the selection of thetargets needed for controlling the interaction and, accordingly, for achievingthe specified parameters of the developed electron-positron plasma and$\gamma$-photon sources. Based on the similarity parameter, variouslaser-plasma interaction modes are identified, the necessary conditions fortheir launch are determined, and the properties of the pair particle and$\gamma$-photon source are revealed. Moreover, qualitative estimates of thequantitative and energy characteristics of such a source are obtained, allowingit to be optimized for various laser beam configurations.",12/3/2024,"['laserparameters', 'laserbeams', 'energyelectrons', 'plasmainteraction', 'lasers']"
Centrifugal Confinement Fusion Thruster,"Abstract: Centrifugal confinement fusion, a promising alternative to toroidalconfinement devices like tokamaks and stellarators, leverages supersonic plasmarotation within a magnetic mirror configuration to achieve simplified coildesign, compactness, and enhanced stability. This brief article explores thepotential of centrifugal confinement fusion for propulsion applications.

Parallel diffusion operator for magnetized plasmas with improved  spectral fidelity,"Abstract: Diffusive transport processes in magnetized plasmas are highly anisotropic,with fast parallel transport along the magnetic field lines sometimes fasterthan perpendicular transport by orders of magnitude. This constitutes a majorchallenge for describing non-grid-aligned magnetic structures in Eulerian(grid-based) simulations. The present paper describes and validates a newmethod for parallel diffusion in magnetized plasmas based on the anti-symmetryrepresentation [Halpern and Waltz, Phys. Plasmas 25, 060703 (2018)]. In theanti-symmetry formalism, diffusion manifests as a flow operator involving thelogarithmic derivative of the transported quantity. Qualitative plane waveanalysis shows that the new operator naturally yields better discrete spectralresolution compared to its conventional counterpart. Numerical simulationscomparing the new method against existing finite difference methods are carriedout, showing significant improvement. In particular, we find that combininganti-symmetry with finite differences in diagonally staggered grids essentiallyeliminates the so-called ""artificial numerical diffusion"" that affectsconventional finite difference and finite volume methods.",12/2/2024,"['spectralresolution', 'plasmas', 'magnetic', 'symmetryrepresentation', 'simulationscomparing']"
Turbulence-Induced Safety Factor Profile Flattening at Rational Surfaces  in Tokamaks with Low Magnetic Shear,"Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of ion-scale turbulence-generatedcurrents on the local safety factor profile under conditions of low magneticshear and proximity to rational surfaces, relevant to Internal TransportBarrier (ITB) formation. Our results show that turbulent currents can generatestationary zonal magnetic potential corrugations, producing a stepped safetyfactor profile with extended regions of zero magnetic shear.

Solar GES-structure modified with EiBI gravity,"Abstract: In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory,considered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativityformalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to studythe dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitationaleffects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitationalPoisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor,termed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity inthe basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existingsolar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model isaccordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on theGravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasmastructure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics isnoticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-modelstudies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows theEiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centricradial location $\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBIgravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the originalNewtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solarparameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Machnumbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses couldbe applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamicsin realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both thebounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.",12/2/2024,"['astroobjects', 'gravitationalpoisson', 'einsteinian', 'relativityformalism', 'solarparameters']"
Spectrally accurate reverse-mode differentiable bounce-averaging  operator and its applications,"Abstract: We present a spectrally accurate bounce-averaging operator implemented as apart of the automatically differentiable DESC stellarator optimization suite.Using this operator, we calculate the proxy for neoclassical transportcoefficient $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}$ in the $1/\nu$ regime and benchmarkit against the NEO code. Ultimately, by employing this differentiableapproximation, for the first time, we directly optimize a finite-$\beta$stellarator to enhance neoclassical transport using reverse-modedifferentiation. This ensures that the computational cost of determining thegradients does not depend on the number of input parameters.",12/2/2024,"['stellarator', 'optimization', 'bounce', 'modedifferentiation', 'automatically']"
Multimodal azimuthal oscillations in electron beam generated $\textbf{E}  \times \textbf{B}$ plasma,"Abstract: Electron beam (e-beam) generated plasmas with applied cross electric andmagnetic $\left( \textbf{E} \times \textbf{B} \right)$ fields are promising forlow-damage material processing. However, these plasmas can be subject to theformation of azimuthally propagating structures that enhance the radialtransport of energetic charged species, which can harm the gentle processingcapability of the plasma. In this work we investigate the azimuthal structureformation in an e-beam generated $\textbf{E} \times \textbf{B}$ plasma usingexperimental diagnostics and 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations. Our findingsdemonstrate the formation of multiple simultaneously occurring azimuthallypropagating modes that exhibit a nontrivial radial dependence. It is suggestedthat the multimodal azimuthal spectrum is caused by the complex nature of theion dynamics in the plasma.",12/2/2024,"['plasma', 'plasmas', 'electron', 'processingcapability', 'electric']"
Hydrogen Utilization as a Plasma Source for Magnetohydrodynamic Direct  Power Extraction (MHD-DPE),"Abstract: This study explores the suitability of hydrogen-based plasma in direct powerextraction (DPE) as a non-conventional electricity generation method. We applycomputational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimatedifferent thermal and electric properties of awater-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levelsof cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\deg}C). This gasmixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometriccombustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metalelement cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture intoelectrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gasmixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) toa major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate thetheoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of ahigh-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma acceleratedinside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to anapplied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimumcesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 ofplasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm(101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarilyhigh at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. Thisestimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3(11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333kPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times theelectric conductivity of seawater).",12/2/2024,"['chemistry', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'physics', 'teslas', 'plasma']"
Multi-Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge Actuators: Geometrical  Optimization of High Power Density Array,"Abstract: Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator arrays have been suggestedas active flow control devices due to the robust electrohydrodynamic (EHD)force generation in variable atmospheric conditions. DBD plasma augmentationschemes allow for significant performance improvements. However, thetransitions to sliding discharge or counter-flow discharge limit their use inhigh-power arrays. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of ascalable DBD array for two alternating phases of air-exposed electrodeconfiguration. Plasma emissions, direct thrust, velocity profiles, and powerconsumption measurements of the DBD array reveal that cross-talk between DBDstages can be eliminated to create high-power density actuators. ACaugmentation of plasma provides additional gains in thrust; however, thetransition to sliding and filamentary discharge reveals geometric limits whenincreasing the array power density. Introducing a segmented electrode with aresistor delays the onset of adverse sliding and filamentary discharge,allowing it to operate at higher voltage inputs. An optimized four-stage DBDarray generated thrust > 250 mN/m with a wall jet thickness > 15 mm, enabling abroader range of flow control applications.",12/2/2024,"['electrohydrodynamic', 'electrodeconfiguration', 'powerconsumption', 'dielectric', 'plasma']"
In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence through the Dyson  Sphere-like structures around the Primordial Black Holes,"Abstract: Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confrontedfor centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of questsfor finding the simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe.The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life willfollowed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificialintelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize the advanced civilizations (onan equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. Wepropose a new scale known as space exploration distance to measure civilizationadvancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale.Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial blackholes as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested bycalculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose anobservational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI usingDyson spheres-like structures around primordial black holes in the Milky Wayand other galaxies.",12/3/2024,"['extraterrestrial', 'civilizations', 'galaxies', 'space', 'centuries']"

The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics: Classical Mechanics II,"Abstract: In this paper of ""The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics"" series weinvestigate Newton's third law and discuss and analyze its epistemologicalsignificance from some aspects with special attention to its relation to theprinciple of conservation of linear and angular momentum. The main issue inthis investigation is the potential violations of this law according to theclaims made in the literature of mainstream physics. This issue may cast ashadow on the validity of classical mechanics, and its Newtonian formulation inparticular, formally and epistemologically and could have importantimplications and consequences on contemporary physics in general. However, whatis more important about this issue from our perspective is the lack of clarity,comprehensibility and coherence in the investigation and analysis of this issueand its implications marked by the absence of appropriate conceptual andepistemological frameworks to deal with this issue properly and systematically.As a result, what we find in the literature is a collection of contradictingviews which are mostly based on personal choices and preferences and selectiveor biased theoretical analysis with the lack of proper experimentalverification and substantiation.",11/15/2024,"['physics', 'newtonian', 'theoretical', 'mechanics', 'epistemologicalsignificance']"

Ionospheric conductances at the giant planets of the Solar System:a  comparative study of ionization sources and the impact of meteoric ions,"Abstract: The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complexinterplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind,and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, theHall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate theintensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and therate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents. Weperform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities andconductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn,Uranus and Neptune. We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studiedions to H3+, CH5+, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductanceson the structure and composition of these planets' upper atmospheres and on themain ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitatingelectrons, and meteoroid ablation). After checking that our model reproducesthe conclusions of Nakamura et al. (2022, this https URL)at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integratedconductances is non-negligible, we show that this contribution could also benon-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionizationprocesses caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV(typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magneticfield, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer wheremeteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role inmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",12/5/2024,"['magnetospheres', 'magnetosphere', 'jupiter', 'ionosphere', 'plasma']"
The hidden magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament revealed  by the injected flare material,"Abstract: Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consistingof accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in thehot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support thefilament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolutionmagnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, wereconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUVobservations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot materialfrom a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magneticstructures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrappedmagnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helicalmagnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of archedmagnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find thatthe northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the samelocation, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas.

Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear:  implications for reconnection onset in the Alfvénic solar wind,"Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet witha strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasingshear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic.We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growthrate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio,the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find thateven a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scalingbehaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shearflow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across theelectron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnectionevents in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's ParkerSolar Probe.",12/2/2024,"['shearflow', 'instability', 'collisionless', 'growthrate', 'shear']"
Effect of 2009 major SSW event on the mesospheric CO2 cooling,"Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2), an important trace species that is gradually increasingin the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities, causes enhanced warming inthe lower atmosphere. The increased concentration of CO2 in the upperatmosphere results in enhanced radiative cooling rates leading to thecontraction of the upper atmosphere. Due to its long lifetime and largevertical gradient, CO2 concentration is also influenced by large dynamicevents. We report a startling case of variability in CO2 density and itsinfrared radiative cooling rates in the mesosphere and lower thermospher duringa major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. A counter-intuitiveconnection between CO2 density and resulting CO2 radiative cooling has beenobserved during the 2009 major SSW event. The behaviour of CO2 cooling ratesduring such a dramatic events draw attention to our current understanding ofCO2 infrared cooling variation and its connection to changes in CO2concentration.

Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas,"Abstract: Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar,and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the ""Hillaslimit"" is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of themaximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shotdirect acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well asstochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments.However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observedmaximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, thatthe observed maximum energy of particles -- those in space, solar,astrophysical, and laboratory environments -- often reach the energy predictedby the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons insolar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons inplanetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discusspossible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is agood chance of detecting ultra-high-energy ($\sim$100 GeV) solar flareelectrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study willfacilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy ofparticles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverseplasma environments.",11/30/2024,"['physics', 'astrophysical', 'radiation', 'flareelectrons', 'cosmic']"
Cross Helicity and the Helium Abundance as a Metric of Solar Wind  Heating and Acceleration: Characterizing the Transition from Magnetically  Closed to Magnetically Open Solar Wind Sources and Identifying the Origin of  the Alfénic Slow Wind,"Abstract: The two-state solar wind paradigm is based on observations showing that slowand fast solar wind have distinct properties like helium abundances, kineticsignatures, elemental composition, and charge-state ratios. Nominally, the fastwind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open tothe heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sourcesthat are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers andpseudostreamers. The Alfv\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solarwind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm. It has slow wind speedsbut is highly Alfv\'enic, i.e. has a high correlation between velocity andmagnetic field fluctuations along with low compressibility typical of Alfv\'enwaves, which is typically observed in fast wind. Its other properties are alsomore similar to the fast than slow wind. From 28 years of Wind observations at1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$),Alfv\'enicity ($\left|\sigma_c\right|$), and solar wind speed($v_\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\left|\sigma_c\right|$and $A_\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasmaaccelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than theminimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions.We infer that the Alfv\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating fromopen-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasmafrom intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications forsolar wind heating and acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination ofhelium abundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar windcategorization scheme.",11/30/2024,"['solarwind', 'solar', 'plasmaaccelerated', 'helium', 'plasmafrom']"

The MuonSpace product achieves improvements in spatial resolution over SMAP withcomparable performance in many regions. An ubRMSE of 0.032 cm$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ forin situ soil moisture observations from SMAP core validation sites is shown,though performance is lower than SMAP's when comparing in forests and/ormountainous terrain.

Preliminary results show that the performance of this lower SWaP OEOsystem is comparable or in some respects better than the electrical systemalready used in the MWS, MWS and MWI missions of ESA. Specifically, a sidemodesuppression of about 46 dB, a phase noise of -102 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, andfrequency stability of 30 kHz in a ten-minute interval is achieved for the45.86 GHz signal. The OEO is a promising candidate to replace or supplement theelectronic systems of phase locked dielectric resonator oscillator andfrequency multipliers used currently in Earth observation.",11/29/2024,"['optoelectronic', 'ghz', 'microwave', 'dielectric', 'esa']"
Night-Side Relativistic Electron Precipitation Bursts in the Outer  Radiation Belt: Insights from ELFIN and THEMIS,"Abstract: Electromagnetic whistler-mode waves play a crucial role in the accelerationand precipitation of radiation belt electrons. Statistical surveys of wavecharacteristics suggest that these waves should preferentially scatter andprecipitate relativistic electrons on the day side. However, the night-sideregion is expected to be primarily associated with electron acceleration. Therecent low-altitude observations reveal relativistic electron precipitation inthe night-side region. In this paper, we present statistical surveys ofnight-side relativistic electron losses due to intense precipitation bursts. Wedemonstrate that such bursts are associated with storm time substorm injectionsand are likely related to relativistic electron scattering by ductedwhistler-mode waves. We also speculate on the role of injections in creatingconditions favorable for relativistic electron precipitation.",11/28/2024,"['wavecharacteristics', 'radiation', 'electromagnetic', 'electrons', 'accelerationand']"

CME propagation in the dynamically coupled space weather tool: COCONUT +  EUHFORIA,"Abstract: This paper aims to present the time-dependent coupling between the coronalmodel COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured (COCONUT) and the heliospheric forecastingtool EUHFORIA.We perform six COCONUT simulations where a flux rope is implemented at thesolar surface using either the Titov-D\'emoulin CME model or the RegularizedBiot-Savart Laws (RBSL) CME model. At regular intervals, the magnetic field,velocity, temperature, and density of the 2D surface $R_{b}=21.5~\;R_{\odot}$are saved in boundary files. This series of coupling files is read in amodified version of EUHFORIA to update progressively its inner boundary. Afterpresenting the early stage of the propagation in COCONUT, we examine how thedisturbance of the solar corona created by the propagation of flux ropes istransmitted into EUHFORIA. In particular, we consider the thermodynamic andmagnetic profiles at L1 and compare them with those obtained at the interfacebetween the two models.We demonstrate that the properties of the heliospheric solar wind in EUHFORIAare consistent with those in COCONUT, acting as a direct extension of thecoronal domain. Moreover, the disturbances initially created from thepropagation of flux ropes in COCONUT continue evolving from the corona in theheliosphere to Earth with a smooth transition at the interface between the twosimulations. Looking at the profile of magnetic field components at Earth anddifferent distances from the Sun, we also find that the transient magneticstructures have a self-similar expansion in COCONUT and EUHFORIA. However, theamplitude of the profiles depends on the flux rope model used and itsproperties, thus emphasizing the important role of the initial properties insolar source regions for accurately predicting the impact of CMEs.",11/28/2024,"['coconut', 'magneticstructures', 'rbsl', 'solar', 'thermodynamic']"
"A study of particle acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the  damping length of kinetic Alfvén waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma","Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermalparticles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, hasbeen a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates theacceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solarcorona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat thecharged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poyntingflux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and thedamping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced bysuprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. Weuse kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigatethe dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, andlow-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kineticlimits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influencedby $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicularPoynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates graduallyfor lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorterdistances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by\kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over longdistances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendiculardirection. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, andthe damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energytransport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding ofparticle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potentialapplications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can alsoapply to other environments.",11/28/2024,"['solar', 'energytransport', 'solarcorona', 'decades', 'heating']"
On the transition from Slow to Fast Wind as Observed in Composition  Observations,"Abstract: The solar wind is typically categorized as fast and slow based on themeasured speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). The separation between these two regimes isoften set between 400 and 600 km/s without a rigorous definition. Observationsof the solar wind's kinetic signatures, chemical makeup, charge stateproperties, and Alfv\'enicity suggest that such a two-state model may beinsufficiently nuanced to capture the relationship between the solar wind andits solar sources. We test this two-state fast/slow solar wind paradigm withheavy ion abundances (X/H) and characterize how the transition between fast andslow wind states impacts heavy ion in the solar wind. We show that (1) thespeed at which heavy ion abundances indicate a change between fast and slowsolar wind as a function of speed is slower than the speed indicated by thehelium abundance; (2) this speed is independent of heavy ion mass and chargestate; (3) the abundance at which heavy ions indicate the transition betweenfast and slow wind is consistent with prior observations of fast windabundances; (4) and there may be a mass or charge-state dependent fractionationprocess present in fast wind heavy ion abundances. We infer that (1)identifying slow solar wind as having a speed $v_\mathrm{sw} \lesssim$ 400 km/smay mix solar wind from polar and equatorial sources; (2) He may be impacted bythe acceleration necessary for the solar wind to reach the asymptotic fast,non-transient values observed at 1 AU; and (3) heavy ions are fractionated inthe fast wind by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism.",11/28/2024,"['windabundances', 'fast', 'slowsolar', 'solar', 'speed']"

Emergent unitary designs for encoded qubits from coherent errors and  syndrome measurements,"Abstract: Unitary $k$-designs are distributions of unitary gates that match the Haardistribution up to its $k$-th statistical moment. They are a crucial resourcefor randomized quantum protocols. However, their implementation on encodedlogical qubits is nontrivial due to the need for magic gates, which can requirea large resource overhead. In this work, we propose an efficient approach togenerate unitary designs for encoded qubits in surface codes by applying localunitary rotations (""coherent errors"") on the physical qubits followed bysyndrome measurement and error correction. We prove that under some conditionson the coherent errors (notably including all single-qubit unitaries) and onthe error correcting code, this process induces a unitary transformation of thelogical subspace. We numerically show that the ensemble of logical unitaries(indexed by the random syndrome outcomes) converges to a unitary design in thethermodynamic limit, provided the density or strength of coherent errors isabove a finite threshold. This ""unitary design"" phase transition coincides withthe code's coherent error threshold under optimal decoding. Furthermore, wepropose a classical algorithm to simulate the protocol based on a ""staircase""implementation of the surface code encoder and decoder circuits. This enables amapping to a 1+1D monitored circuit, where we observe an entanglement phasetransition (and thus a classical complexity phase transition of the decodingalgorithm) coinciding with the aforementioned unitary design phase transition.Our results provide a practical way to realize unitary designs on encodedqubits, with applications including quantum state tomography and benchmarkingin error correcting codes.",12/5/2024,"['magic', 'quantum', 'decodingalgorithm', 'algorithm', 'decoder']"
Boosting quantum annealing performance through direct polynomial  unconstrained binary optimization,"Abstract: Quantum annealing aims at solving optimization problems of practicalrelevance using quantum computing hardware. Problems of interest are typicallyformulated in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)Hamiltonians. However, many optimization problems are much more naturallyformulated in terms of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO)functions of higher order. As we show with various problem examples, leveragingthe PUBO formulation can bring considerable savings in terms of required numberof qubits. Moreover, in numerical benchmarks for the paradigmatic 3-SATproblem, we find scenarios where the scaling of the minimal gap during theoptimization sweep differs significantly, suggesting the possibility of anexponentially faster annealing time when using the PUBO as compared to the QUBOformulation. This advantage persists even when considering the overhead inimplementing the higher-order interactions necessary for PUBO costHamiltonians. As an interesting side effect, the analysis on minimum energygaps of different 3-SAT instance generators reveals different degrees ofhardness, which will be of interest also for classical benchmark calculations.Our findings show a promising path to improving the resource efficiency andsweeping speed of quantum annealing, important prerequisites when aiming atsolving larger optimization problems with relevance to industry.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'optimization', 'improving', 'practicalrelevance', 'computing']"
Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation,"Abstract: Quantum amplitude estimation is a fundamental routine that offers a quadraticspeed-up over classical approaches. The original QAE protocol is based on phaseestimation. The associated circuit depth and width, and the assumptions offault tolerance, are unfavorable for near-term quantum technology. Subsequentapproaches attempt to replace the original protocol with hybrid iterativequantum-classical strategies. In this work, we introduce BAE, a noise-awareBayesian algorithm for QAE that combines quantum circuits with a statisticalinference backbone. BAE can dynamically characterize device noise and adapt toit in real-time. Problem-specific insights and approximations are used to keepthe problem tractable. We further propose an annealed variant of BAE, drawingon methods from statistical inference, to enhance statistical robustness. Ourproposal is parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offerstools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexistinginformation. Additionally, it accommodates experimental limitations andpreferred cost trade-offs. We show that BAE achieves Heisenberg-limitedestimation and benchmark it against other approaches, demonstrating itscompetitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.",12/5/2024,"['quadraticspeed', 'quantum', 'algorithm', 'iterativequantum', 'subsequentapproaches']"
Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks,"Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum informationtheory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications,including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and nodecentrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution ofquantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution.However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-timebehavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on theirevolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks onnetworks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networksthat we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive ananalytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio thatdepends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Buildingon the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occursin Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law clusternetworks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a keystructural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'algorithms', 'clusternetworks', 'eigenvectors', 'onnetworks']"
Two-detector reconstruction of multiphoton states in linear optical  networks,"Abstract: We propose a method for partial state reconstruction of multiphoton states inmultimode ($N$-photon $M$-mode) linear optical networks (LONs) employing onlytwo bucket photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors. The reconstructedHeisenberg-Weyl-reduced (HW-reduced) density matrix captures quantum coherenceand symmetry with respect to HW operators. Employing deterministic quantumcomputing with one qubit (DQC1) circuits, we reduce the detector requirementfrom $M$ to $2$, while the requirement on measurement configurations areretained $\mathcal{O}(M^{\max(3,N)})$. To ensure physicality, maximumlikelihood estimation (MLE) is incorporated into the DQC1 reconstructionprocess, with numerical simulations demonstrating the robustness and efficiencyof our approach. This method offers a resource-efficient solution for statecharacterization in large-scale LONs to advance photonic quantum technologies.",12/5/2024,"['quantumcomputing', 'reconstructionprocess', 'quantum', 'multiphoton', 'photonic']"
A purified input-output pseudomode model for structured open quantum  systems,"Abstract: A full understanding of open quantum systems requires the characterization ofboth system and environmental properties.

Here we presenta model consisting of purified auxiliary bosonic modes to describe, alongsideproperties of the system, the dynamics of environmental observables for bosonicbaths prepared in non-Gaussian initial states. We numerically exemplify thismethod by simulating non-Markovian multi-photon transfer processes on a coupledcavity waveguide system in the large time delay regime.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'bosonicbaths', 'hybridizationand', 'coupledcavity', 'environmental']"
Multipartite entanglement distribution in Bell-pair networks without  Steiner trees and with reduced gate cost,"Abstract: Multipartite entangled states, particularly Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger(GHZ) and other graph states, are important resources in multiparty quantumnetwork protocols and measurement-based quantum computing. We consider theproblem of generating such states from networks of bipartite entangled (Bell)pairs. Although an optimal protocol (in terms of time steps and consumed Bellpairs) for generating GHZ states in Bell-pair networks has been identified in[Phys. Rev. A 100, 052333 (2019)], it makes use of at most $O(N^2)$ gates,where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. It also involves solving theNP-hard Steiner tree problem as an initial step. Reducing the gate cost is animportant consideration now and into the future, because both qubits and gateoperations are noisy. To this end, we present a protocol for producing GHZstates in arbitrary Bell-pair networks that provably requires only $O(N)$gates, and we present numerical evidence that our protocol indeed reduces thegate cost on real-world network models, compared to prior work. Notably, thegate cost of our protocol depends only on the number of nodes and isindependent of the topology of the network. At the same time, our protocolmaintains nearly the optimal number of consumed Bell pairs, and it avoidsfinding a Steiner tree or solving any other computationally hard problem byrunning in polynomial time with respect to $N$. By considering the number ofgates as a figure of merit, our work approaches entanglement distribution fromthe perspective that, in practice, unlike the traditional information-theoreticsetting, local operations and classical communications are not free.",12/5/2024,"['quantumnetwork', 'quantum', 'ghzstates', 'ghz', 'computationally']"
Exited-state quantum phase transitions in constrained systems,"Abstract: We extend the standard semiclassical theory of Exited-State Quantum PhaseTransitions (ESQPTs), based on a classification of stationary points in theclassical Hamiltonian, to constrained systems. We adopt the method of Lagrangemultipliers to find all stationary points and their properties directly fromthe Hamiltonian constrained by an arbitrary number of integrals of motion, anddemonstrate the procedure on an algebraic u(3) boson model with two independentconstraints. We also elaborate the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) mapping, used toeliminate one degree of freedom in bosonic systems constrained by a conservednumber of excitations, and address the fact that this mapping leads, in theclassical limit, to a compact phase space with singular behaviour that concealssome stationary points at the phase space boundary. It is shown that the HPmethod reveals all ESQPTs only after constructing a complete atlas of differentHP mappings.",12/5/2024,"['quantum', 'phasetransitions', 'hpmethod', 'hamiltonian', 'lagrangemultipliers']"
Pruning qLDPC codes: Towards bivariate bicycle codes with open boundary  conditions,"Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are promising candidates for quantumerror correcting codes as they might offer more resource-efficient alternativesto surface code architectures.

In this work, we will explore howone can transform bivariate bicycle codes defined on lattices with periodicboundary conditions to codes with the same locality properties on a 2D latticewith open boundary conditions. For this, we introduce the concept of pruningquantum codes. We explain how pruning bivariate bicycle codes is alwayspossible when the codes are hypergraph products of two classical cyclic codes.We also indicate that this might be possible for more general bivariate bicyclecodes by constructing explicit examples. Finally, we investigate fault-tolerantquantum computation using the constructed pruned codes by describingfold-transversal gates.",12/5/2024,"['bicyclecodes', 'quantumerror', 'bicycle', 'efficient', 'quantum']"

Demonstration of Enhanced Qubit Readout via Reinforcement Learning,"Abstract: Measurement is an essential component for robust and practical quantumcomputation. For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves theeffective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and shouldideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with theshortest readout pulse and resonator reset time.

We demonstrate on the IBM quantumdevice that the measurement pulse obtained by the RL agent not onlysuccessfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of$(4.6 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-3}$, but also executes the readout and the subsequentresonator reset almost 3x faster than the system's default process.Furthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameterdrifts and follow a generalized analytical form, making them readilyimplementable in practice with no significant computation overhead.

Calibration of cascaded phase shifters using pairwise scan method in  silicon photonics integrated chip,"Abstract: Cascaded phase shifters (CPSs) based on silicon photonics integrated chipsplay important roles in quantum information processing tasks. Owing to anincrease in the scale of silicon photonics chips, the time required tocalibrate various CPSs has increased. We propose a pairwise scan method forrapidly calibrating CPSs by introducing equivalent Mach Zehnder Interferometerstructures and a reasonable constraint of the initial relative phase. Thecalibration can be nearly completed when the scanning process is finished, andonly a little calculation is required. To achieve better performance, the keycomponents, thermal optical phase shifter and 2 * 2 50/50 multimodeinterference coupler, were simulated and optimized to prevent thermal crosstalkand ensure a good balance. A 6-CPSs structure in a packaged silicon photonicschip under different temperature was used to verify the rapid pairwise scanmethod, and a fidelity of 99.97% was achieved.",12/5/2024,"['interferometerstructures', 'photonicschip', 'photonics', 'calibrating', 'quantum']"

For a dissipativequantum oscillating system, it is demonstrated that number states $|N\ra$intersect with coherent states $|\alpha\ra$, with this intersection occurringearlier for smaller values of $N$. Additionally, thermal states intersect withcoherent states for specific values of $|\alpha|$, leading to the occurrence ofthe ME in these two scenarios. A weaker version of the ME is also observed forthermal and number states. In the case of a quantum TLS, it is shown that theME effect occurs, and the potential for its realization and experimentalobservation is discussed, with reference to the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM)involving a decaying time-dependent coupling function.",12/5/2024,"['quantumoscillating', 'quantum', 'experimentalobservation', 'matrices', '1402']"

Squeezing and Entanglement Dynamics in Phase-Sensitive Non-Hermitian  Systems,"Abstract: Over the past decade, parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT (APT) symmetry invarious physical systems have been extensively studied, leading to significantexperimental and theoretical advancements. However, physical systems thatsimultaneously exhibit both PT and APT symmetry have not yet been explored. Inthis study, we construct a phase-sensitive non-Hermitian wave mixing model thatinherently possesses single-mode APT symmetry. By tuning the phase of the pumpfield, this model simultaneously exhibits two-mode quadrature-PT symmetry.Moreover, the APT phase transition is accompanied by the emergence of quantumentanglement from absence to presence. This remarkable quantum effect, quantumentanglement, which distinguishes itself from classical physics, issurprisingly linked to APT symmetry phase transition.

Inequivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting ofhomology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory ofa finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with$\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work ofAbouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirshi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can definecomplex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbirary (closed)symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of thespace of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$.

On high genus extensions of Negami's conjecture,"Abstract: Negami's famous planar cover conjecture is equivalent to the statement that aconnected graph can be embedded in the projective plane if and only if it has aprojective planar cover. In 1999, Hlin\v{e}n\'y proposed extending thisconjecture to higher genus non-orientable surfaces. In this paper, we putforward a natural extension that encompasses orientable surfaces as well; forevery compact surface $\Sigma$, a connected graph $G$ has a finite coverembeddable in $\Sigma$ if and only if $G$ is embeddable in a surface covered by$\Sigma$.As evidence toward this, we prove that for every surface $\Sigma$, theconnected graphs with a finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ have bounded Eulergenus. Moreover, we show that these extensions of Negami's conjecture aredecidable for every compact surface of sufficiently large Euler genus,surpassing what is known for Negami's original conjecture. We also prove thenatural analogue for countable graphs embeddable into a compact (orientable)surface. More precisely, we prove that a connected countable graph $G$ has afinite ply cover that embeds into a compact (orientable) surface if and only if$G$ embeds into a compact (orientable) surface.Our most general theorem, from which these results are derived, is that thereis a constant $c>0$ such that for every surface $\Sigma$, there exists adecreasing function $p_\Sigma:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\lim_{g\to\infty}p_\Sigma(g) =0$ such that every finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ ofany connected graph with Euler genus $g\ge c$ has ply at most $p_\Sigma(g)$.",12/5/2024,"['theorem', 'graphs', 'graph', 'mathbb', 'euler']"

When the families consist of monomial ideals, the convex bodies beingconsidered are the Newton-Okounkov bodies of the families. When ideals in thesecond family are classical invariant ideals, for instance, determinantalideals or ideals of Pfaffians, these convex bodies are constructed from theassociated Rees packages.",12/5/2024,"['convexbodies', 'combinatorial', 'newton', 'classical', 'pfaffians']"
Stabilizing and Solving Inverse Problems using Data and Machine Learning,"Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solutionto a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundaryconditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a largedataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and abulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data,we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensionalstructure in the expansion coefficients using an auto-encoder, which provides aparametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We thentrain a neural network to map the latent variables representing the boundarydata to the solution of the PDE. Finally, we solve the inverse problem byoptimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space.We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method in the linearsetting and establish optimal error estimates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$-norms. Thenonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectivenessof our approach.",12/5/2024,"['reconstruction', 'decomposition', 'nonlinear', 'linearsetting', 'equation']"
Providing Differential Privacy for Federated Learning Over Wireless: A  Cross-layer Framework,"Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework thatinherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thusproviding some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a riskof privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is anadapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the naturalsuperposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physicallayer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) througha decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussiannoise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additionalartificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Althoughprimarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where aresource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every eveniteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power controlstrategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx asshown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectivenessof our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strongemphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificialnoise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacywithout affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacyanalysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform aconvergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous datadistributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy andaccuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithmsoutperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d.FEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness inensuring strict privacy.",12/5/2024,"['algorithmsoutperforms', 'privacyanalysis', 'wireless', 'algorithms', 'datadistributions']"
Learning on hexagonal structures and Monge-Ampère operators,Abstract: Dually flat statistical manifolds provide a rich toolbox for investigationsaround the learning process. We prove that such manifolds are Monge-Amp\`eremanifolds. Examples of such manifolds include the space of exponentialprobability distributions on finite sets and the Boltzmann manifolds. Ourinvestigations of Boltzmann manifolds lead us to prove that Monge-Amp\`ereoperators control learning methods for Boltzmann machines. Using local trivialfibrations (webs) we demonstrate that on such manifolds the webs areparallelizable and can be constructed using a generalisation of Ceva's theorem.Assuming that our domain satisfies certain axioms of 2D topological quantumfield theory we show that locally the learning can be defined on hexagonalstructures. This brings a new geometric perspective for defining the optimallearning process.,12/5/2024,"['quantumfield', 'theorem', 'areparallelizable', 'manifolds', 'optimallearning']"
Intertwining operators beyond the Stark Effect,"Abstract: The main mathematical manifestation of the Stark effect in quantum mechanicsis the shift and the formation of clusters of eigenvalues when a sphericalHamiltonian is perturbed by lower order terms. Understanding this mechanismturned out to be fundamental in the description of the large-time asymptoticsof the associated Schr\""odinger groups and can be responsible for the lack ofdispersion in Fanelli, Felli, Fontelos and Primo [Comm. Math. Phys., 324(2013),1033-1067; 337(2015), 1515-1533]. Recently, Miao, Su, and Zheng introduced in[Tran. Amer. Math. Soc., 376(2023), 1739--1797] a family of spectrallyprojected intertwining operators, reminiscent of the Kato's wave operators, inthe case of constant perturbations on the sphere (inverse-square potential),and also proved their boundedness in $L^p$. Our aim is to establish a generalframework in which some suitable intertwining operators can be defined also fornon constant spherical perturbations in space dimensions 2 and higher. Inaddition, we investigate the mapping properties between $L^p$-spaces of theseoperators. In 2D, we prove a complete result, for the Schr\""odinger Hamiltonianwith a (fixed) magnetic potential an electric potential, both scaling critical,allowing us to prove dispersive estimates, uniform resolvent estimates, and$L^p$-bounds of Bochner--Riesz means. In higher dimensions, apart fromrecovering the example of inverse-square potential, we can conjecture acomplete result in presence of some symmetries (zonal potentials), and opensome interesting spectral problems concerning the asymptotics ofeigenfunctions.",12/5/2024,"['mathematical', 'math', 'quantum', 'asymptotics', 'eigenvalues']"

Superdiffusive Scaling Limits for the Symmetric Exclusion Process with  Slow Bonds,"Abstract: In \cite{fgn1}, the hydrodynamic limit in the diffusive scaling of thesymmetric simple exclusion process with a finite number of slow bonds ofstrength $n^{-\beta}$ has been studied. Here $n$ is the scaling parameter and$\beta>0$ is fixed. As shown in \cite{fgn1}, when $\beta>1$, such a limit isgiven by the heat equation with Neumann boundary conditions. In this work, wefind more non-trivial super-diffusive scaling limits for this dynamics. Assumethat there are $k$ equally spaced slow bonds in the system.If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^\theta$, with $\theta\in(2,1+\beta)$, the density is asymptotically constant in each of the $k$ boxes,and equal to the initial expected mass in that box, i.e., there is no timeevolution. If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\beta}$, then thedensity is also spatially constant in each box, but evolves in time accordingto the discrete heat equation. Finally, if the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\beta}$and, additionally, the number of boxes $k$ increases to infinity, then thesystem converges to the continuous heat equation on the torus, with no boundaryconditions.",12/5/2024,"['hydrodynamic', 'timeevolution', 'equation', 'beta', 'neumann']"
"Hypergraph burning, matchings, and zero forcing","Abstract: Lazy burning is a recently introduced variation of burning where only one setof vertices is chosen to burn in the first round. In hypergraphs, lazy burningspreads when all but one vertex in a hyperedge is burned. The lazy burningnumber is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burnsall vertices. We give several equivalent characterizations of lazy burning onhypergraphs using matchings and zero forcing, and then apply these to give newbounds and complexity results.We prove that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph $H$ equals its orderminus the maximum cardinality of a certain matching on its incidence graph.Using this characterization, we give a formula for the lazy burning number of adual hypergraph and give new bounds on the lazy burning number based on varioushypergraph parameters. We show that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph maybe characterized by a maximal subhypergraph that results from iterativelydeleting vertices in singleton hyperedges.We prove that lazy burning on a hypergraph is equivalent to zero forcing onits incidence graph and show an equivalence between skew zero forcing on agraph and lazy burning on its neighborhood hypergraph. As a result, we showthat finding an upper bound on the lazy burning number of a hypergraph isNP-complete, which resolves a conjecture from \cite{BJR}. By applying lazyburning, we show that computing an upper bound on the skew zero forcing numberfor bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We finish with open problems.",12/5/2024,"['burningnumber', 'burningspreads', 'iterativelydeleting', 'burn', 'burned']"

Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups II: quotients and the Hopf  property for Artin groups,"Abstract: We prove that most Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type are Hopfian,meaning that every self-epimorphism is an isomorphism. The class covered by ourresult is generic, in the sense of Goldsborough-Vaskou. Moreover, assuming theresidual finiteness of certain hyperbolic groups with an explicit presentation,we get that all large and hyperbolic type Artin groups are residually finite.We also show that most quotients of the five-holed sphere mapping class groupare hierarchically hyperbolic, up to taking powers of the normal generators ofthe kernels. The main tool we use to prove both results is a Dehn-filling-likeprocedure for short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (these also include e.g.non-geometric 3-manifolds, and triangle- and square-free RAAGs).",12/5/2024,"['hyperbolic', 'manifolds', 'isomorphism', 'large', 'goldsborough']"
Sensor-Driven Predictive Vehicle Maintenance and Routing Problem with  Time Windows,"Abstract: Advancements in sensor technology offer significant insights into vehicleconditions, unlocking new venues to enhance fleet operations. While currentvehicle health management models provide accurate predictions of vehiclefailures, they often fail to integrate these forecasts into operationaldecision-making, limiting their practical impact. This paper addresses this gapby incorporating sensor-driven failure predictions into a single-vehiclerouting problem with time windows. A maintenance cost function is introduced tobalance two critical trade-offs: premature maintenance, which leads tounderutilization of remaining useful life, and delayed maintenance, whichincreases the likelihood of breakdowns. Routing problems with time windows areinherently challenging, and integrating maintenance considerations addssignificantly to its computational complexity. To address this, we develop anew solution method, called the Iterative Alignment Method (IAM), building onthe structural properties of the problem. IAM generates high-quality solutionseven in large-size instances where Gurobi cannot find any solutions. Moreover,compared to the traditional periodic maintenance strategy, our sensor-drivenapproach to maintenance decisions shows improvements in operational andmaintenance costs as well as in overall vehicle reliability.",12/5/2024,"['drivenapproach', 'operationaldecision', 'iterative', 'addssignificantly', 'improvements']"
Fractional counting process at Lévy times and its applications,"Abstract: Traditionally, fractional counting processes, such as the fractional Poissonprocess, etc. have been defined using fractional differential and integraloperators. Recently, Laskin (2024) introduced a generalized fractional countingprocess (FCP) by changing the probability mass function (pmf) of the timefractional Poisson process using the generalized three-parameter Mittag-Lefflerfunction. Here, we study some additional properties for the FCP and introduce atime-changed fractional counting process (TCFCP), defined by time-changing theFCP with an independent L\'evy subordinator. We derive distributionalproperties such as the Laplace transform, probability generating function, themoments generating function, mean, and variance for the TCFCP. Some resultsrelated to waiting time distribution and the first passage time distributionare also discussed. We define the multiplicative and additive compound variantsfor the FCP and the TCFCP and examine their distributional characteristics withsome typical examples. We explore some interesting connections of the TCFCPwith Bell polynomials by introducing subordinated generalized fractional Bellpolynomials. It is shown that the moments of the TCFCP can be represented interms of the subordinated generalized fractional Bell polynomials. Finally, wepresent the application of the FCP in a shock deterioration model.",12/5/2024,"['countingprocess', '2024', 'poissonprocess', 'timefractional', 'bellpolynomials']"
The critical Karp--Sipser core of Erdős--Rényi random graphs,"Abstract: The Karp--Sipser algorithm consists in removing recursively the leaves aswell their unique neighbours and all isolated vertices of a given graph. Theremaining graph obtained when there is no leaf left is called the Karp--Sipsercore. When the underlying graph is the classical sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyirandom graph $ \mathrm{G}[n, \lambda/n]$, it is known to exhibit a phasetransition at $\lambda = \mathrm{e}$. We show that at criticality, theKarp--Sipser core has size of order $n^{3/5}$, which proves a conjecture ofBauer and Golinelli. We provide the asymptotic law of this renormalized size aswell as a description of the distribution of the core as a graph. Our approachrelies on the differential equation method, and builds up on a previous work ona configuration model with bounded degrees.",12/5/2024,"['graph', 'algorithm', 'renormalized', 'sipsercore', 'removing']"

Cluster structures on Cox rings,"Abstract: We construct a graded cluster algebra structure on the Cox ring of a smoothcomplex variety $Z$, depending on a base cluster structure on the ring ofregular functions of an open subset $Y$ of $Z$.

First: if $Z$ is a flag variety and $Y$ is the openSchubert cell, we prove that our results recover, by geometric methods, a wellknown construction of Geiss, Leclerc and Schr\""oer. Second: we define thediagonal partial compactification of a (finite type) cluster variety, and provethat its Cox ring is a graded upper cluster algebra. Along the way, we explainhow similar constructions can be done if we replace the Cox ring with a ring ofglobal sections of a sheaf of divisorial algebras on $Z$.",12/5/2024,"['algebras', 'algebra', 'openschubert', 'someelementary', 'compactification']"

Secondly, we introduce the notion ofcoupled stability thresholds for graded linear series, which is ageneralization of the notion introduced by Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang. We seethat, over the interior of the support for finite numbers of graded linearseries containing an ample series, the coupled stability threshold function canbe uniquely extended continuously, which generalizes the work by Kewei Zhang.Thirdly, we get a product-type formula for coupled stability thresholds, whichgeneralizes the work of Zhuang.

Estimating the persistent homology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions  using function-geometric multifiltrations,"Abstract: Given an unknown $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function $f$ on a metric space $X$,can we approximate the persistent homology of $f$ from a finite sampling of $X$with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has beenanswered in the case $n=1$, assuming $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $X$ is asufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometriccomplexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper weanswer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and usingfunction-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view onthese multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties ratherthan on their stability properties.

Alpha shapes and optimal transport on the sphere,"Abstract: In [3], the authors used the Legendre transform to give a tractable methodfor studying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in terms of sums of Gaussiankernels. In this paper, we prove a variant for sums of cosine similarity-basedkernel functions, which requires considering the more general ""$c$-transform""from optimal transport theory [16]. We then apply these methods to a pointcloud arising from a recent breakthrough study, which exhibits a toroidalstructure in the brain activity of rats [11]. A key part of this application isthat the transport map and transformed density function arising from thetheorem replace certain delicate preprocessing steps related to density-baseddenoising and subsampling.",12/5/2024,"['rats', 'preprocessing', 'studying', 'gaussiankernels', 'transform']"
Chain level Koszul duality between the Gravity and Hypercommutative  operads,"Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero stablecurves with $(n+1)$-marked points. The collection$\overline{\mathcal{M}}=\{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}\}_{n\geq 2}$ forms anoperad in the category of complex projective varieties; its homology $Hycom=H_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is called the Hypercommutative operad. In thispaper we construct a chain model for the hypercommutative operad, i.e. anoperad of chain complexes $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ which is weaklyequivalent to the operad of singular chains $C_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$. Weprove that $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is the linear dual of the barconstruction $B(grav)$, where $grav$ is a chain model of the gravity operadbased on cacti without basepoint. This shows that the Gravity andHypercommutative operad are Koszul dual also at the chain level, refining aprevious result of Getzler. The construction is topological, since$C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})(n)$ is the cellular complex associated to aregular CW-decomposition of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$.",12/4/2024,"['mathcal', 'hypercommutative', 'andhypercommutative', 'topological', 'c_']"
Higher crossed modules of algebras over an operad,"Abstract: We study crossed modules in the context of algebras over an operad. To do so,in the first section, we adapt the methods of Janelidze by reviewing thenotions of internal actions, precrossed modules and crossed modules in theoperadic case. Moreover, we extract the Peiffer relations, well known in theLie case, for precrossed modules over an arbitrary operad. We prove that ournotion of crossed modules is equivalent to the one of Janelidze by proving thatour crossed modules of algebras over a fixed operad are equivalent tocategories internal to algebras over this fixed operad. In the second section,we study the notion of crossed modules of algebras over an operad as introducedby Leray-Riviere-Wagemann in arXiv:2411.04614 and prove it to be equivalent tothe already existing notions of crossed modules. Roughly speaking, a crossedmodule in the sense of Leray-Rivi\`ere-Wagemann is an algebra structure on achain complex concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. We highlight a ""codescent""process which allows us to endow the degree one and zero terms of the chaincomplex with algebra structures such that the differential is an algebramorphism. Moreover, we prove it to be a crossed module. In fact we prove thatthe approach to crossed modules of Leray-Riviere-Wagemann is equivalent to theone of Janelidze. This new approach, together with the codescent process,allows us to introduce higher crossed modules in a very concise and explicitway, and we prove them to be equivalent to n-fold categories internal toalgebras, for some n.",12/4/2024,"['algebramorphism', 'algebras', 'algebra', 'crossedmodule', 'degrees']"
IntComplex for high-order interactions,"Abstract: Graphs serve as powerful tools for modeling pairwise interactions in diversefields such as biology, material science, and social networks. However, theyinherently overlook interactions involving more than two entities. Simplicialcomplexes and hypergraphs have emerged as prominent frameworks for modelingmany-body interactions; nevertheless, they exhibit limitations in capturingspecific high-order interactions, particularly those involving transitions from$n$-interactions to $m$-interactions. Addressing this gap, we proposeIntComplex as an innovative framework to characterize such high-orderinteractions comprehensively. Our framework leverages homology theory toprovide a quantitative representation of the topological structure inherent insuch interactions. IntComplex is defined as a collection of interactions, eachof which can be equivalently represented by a binary tree. Drawing inspirationfrom GLMY homology, we introduce homology for the detailed analysis ofstructural patterns formed by interactions across adjacent dimensions,$p$-layer homology to elucidate loop structures within $p$-interactions inspecific dimensions, and multilayer homology to analyze loop structures ofinteractions across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce persistenthomology through a filtration process and establish its stability to ensurerobust quantitative analysis of these complex interactions. The proposedIntComplex framework establishes a foundational paradigm for the analysis oftopological properties in high-order interactions, presenting significantpotential to drive forward the advancements in the domain of complex networkanalysis.",12/3/2024,"['graphs', 'networkanalysis', 'hypergraphs', 'science', 'topological']"

Persistent (Co)Homology in Matrix Multiplication Time,"Abstract: Most algorithms for computing persistent homology do so by tracking cyclesthat represent homology classes. There are many choices of such cycles, andspecific choices have found different uses in applications. Although it isknown that persistence diagrams can be computed in matrix multiplication time[8] for the more general case of zigzag persistent homology, it is not clearhow to extract cycle representatives, especially if specific representativesare desired. In this paper, we provide the same matrix multiplication bound forcomputing representatives for the two choices common in applications in thecase of ordinary persistent (co)homology. We first provide a fast version ofthe reduction algorithm, which is simpler than the algorithm in [8], butreturns a different set of representatives than the standard algorithm [6] Wethen give a fast version of a different variant called the row algorithm [4],which returns the same representatives as the standard algorithm.",12/3/2024,"['algorithms', 'algorithm', 'forcomputing', 'multiplication', 'computing']"

Representation stability in the (co)homology of vertical configuration  spaces,"Abstract: In this paper, we study sequences of topological spaces called ""verticalconfiguration spaces"" of points in Euclidean space. We apply the theory ofFI$_G$-modules, and results of Bianchi-Kranhold, to show that their(co)homology groups are ""representation stable"" with respect to natural actionsof wreath products $S_k \wr S_n$. In particular, we show that in each(co)homological degree, the (co)homology groups (viewed as $S_k \wrS_n$-representations) can be expressed as induced representations of a specificform. Consequently, the characters of their rational (co)homology groups, andthe patterns of irreducible $S_k \wr S_n$-representation constituents of thesegroups, stabilize in a strong sense. In addition, we give a new proof ofrational (co)homological stability for unordered vertical configuration spaces,with an improved stable range.",12/2/2024,"['euclidean', 'topological', 'homology', 'spaces', 'space']"

In the ungraded case, we reduce to an equivalencebetween projectively flat vector bundles and a subcategory of projectiverepresentations of $\pi_1(M; x_0)$. As an application of our general framework,we also prove that the category of cohesive modules over the curved Dolbeaultalgebra of a complex manifold $X$ is equivalent to a subcategory of the boundedderived category of twisted sheaves of $\mathcal O_X$-modules which generalizesa theorem due to Block to possibly non-compact complex manifolds.",11/29/2024,"['riemann', 'manifolds', 'cohomology', 'mathbb', 'theorem']"
Topology-Preserving Scaling in Data Augmentation,"Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework for dataset normalization in dataaugmentation pipelines that preserves topological stability under non-uniformscaling transformations. Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), we consider scaling transformationsdefined by scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n > 0 \). Specifically, wedefine a scaling function \( S \) that maps each point \( x = (x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n) \in X \) to \[ S(x) = (s_1 x_1, s_2 x_2, \ldots, s_n x_n). \] Ourmain result establishes that the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) betweenthe persistence diagrams \( D \) of \( X \) and \( D_S \) of \( S(X) \)satisfies: \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot\operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \),\( s_{\max} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \)is the diameter of \( X \). Based on this theoretical guarantee, we formulatean optimization problem to minimize the scaling variability \( \Delta_s =s_{\max} - s_{\min} \) under the constraint \( d_B(D, D_S) \leq \epsilon \),where \( \epsilon > 0 \) is a user-defined tolerance.We develop an algorithmic solution to this problem, ensuring that dataaugmentation via scaling transformations preserves essential topologicalfeatures. We further extend our analysis to higher-dimensional homologicalfeatures, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterativeor probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our contributions provide a rigorousmathematical framework for dataset normalization in data augmentationpipelines, ensuring that essential topological characteristics are maintaineddespite scaling transformations.",11/29/2024,"['topologicalfeatures', 'mathbb', 'algorithmic', 'transformationsdefined', 'augmentationpipelines']"

Decomposing zero-dimensional persistent homology over rooted tree  quivers,"Abstract: Given a functor from any category into the category of topological spaces,one obtains a linear representation of the category by post-composing the givenfunctor with a homology functor with field coefficients. This construction isfundamental in persistence theory, where it is known as persistent homology,and where the category is typically a poset. Persistence theory is particularlysuccessful when the poset is a finite linearly ordered set, owing to the factthat in this case its category of representations is of finite type. We showthat when the poset is a rooted tree poset (a poset with a maximum and whoseHasse diagram is a tree) the additive closure of the category ofrepresentations obtainable as zero-dimensional persistent homology is of finitetype, and give a quadratic-time algorithm for decomposition intoindecomposables. In doing this, we give an algebraic characterization of theadditive closure in terms of Ringel's tree modules, and show that itsindecomposable objects are the reduced representations of Kinser.",11/28/2024,"['algebraic', 'algorithm', 'quadratic', 'topological', 'homology']"

Sharp-Interface Limit of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot Equations,"Abstract: In this letter, we derive the sharp-interface limit of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biotequations using formal matched asymptotic expansions. We find that in eachsub-domain, the quasi-static Biot equations are obtained with domain-specificmaterial parameters. Moreover, across the interface, material displacement andpore pressure are continuous, while volumetric fluid content and normal stressare balanced. By utilizing the energy of the system, the phase-field potentialis shown to be influenced by the curvature, along with contributions from bothflow and elasticity at the interface. The normal velocity of the interface isproportional to the jump in normal derivative of the phase-field potentialacross the interface. Finally, we present a numerical experiment thatdemonstrates how the location of each phase evolves consistently as thediffuse-interface width parameter becomes smaller; only the width of thediffuse interface changes.",12/5/2024,"['equations', 'curvature', 'volumetric', 'elasticity', 'biotequations']"

Convergence of boundary layers of chemotaxis models with physical  boundary conditions~II: Non-degenerate,"Abstract: This paper establishes the convergence of boundary-layer solutions of theconsumption type Keller-Segel model with non-degenerate initial data subject tophysical boundary conditions, which is a sequel of\cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} on the case of degenerate initial data.Specifically, we justify that the solution with positive chemical diffusionrate $\varepsilon>0 $ converges to the solution with zero diffusion$\varepsilon=0 $ (outer-layer solution) plus the boundary-layer profiles(inner-layer solution) for any time $t>0$ as $ \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 $.Compared to \cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing}, the main difficulty in theanalysis is the lack of regularity of the outer- and boundary-layer profilessince only the zero-order compatibility conditions for the leading-orderboundary-layer profiles can be fulfilled with non-degenerate initial data. Ournew strategy is to regularize the boundary-layer profiles with carefullydesigned corner-corrector functions and approximate the low-regularityleading-order boundary-layer profiles by higher-regularity profiles withregularized boundary conditions. By using delicate weight functions involvingboundary-layer profiles to cancel the multi-scaled linear terms in theperturbed equations, we manage to obtain the requisite uniform-in-$ \varepsilon$ estimates for the convergence analysis. This cancellation technique enablesus to prove the convergence to boundary-layer solutions for any time $ t >0 $,which is different from the convergence result in\cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} which holds true only for some finite timedepending on the Dirichlet boundary value.",12/5/2024,"['convergence', 'orderboundary', 'involvingboundary', 'diffusionrate', 'timedepending']"

Local boundedness of solutions to parabolic equations associated with  fractional $p$-Laplacian type operators,"Abstract: In this paper, we study the local boundedness of local weak solutions to thefollowing parabolic equation associated with fractional $p$-Laplacian typeoperators $$ \partial_tu(t,x)-\text{p.v.}\int_{\R^d}|u(t,y)-u(t,x)|^{p-2}(u(t,y)-u(t,x))J(t;x,y)\,dy=0,\quad(t,x)\in \R\times \R^d, $$ where $\text{p.v.}$ means the integral in theprincipal value sense, $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $J(t;x,y)$ is comparable to thekernel of the fractional $p$-Laplacian operator $|x-y|^{-d-sp}$ with$s\in(0,1)$ and uniformly in $(t;x,y)\in\R\times\R^d\times\R^d$. Unlikeexisting results in the literature, the local boundedness of the solutionsobtained in this paper extends the known results for the linear case (i.e., thecase that $p=2$), in particular with a nonlocal parabolic tail that uses the$L^1$-norm in time for all $p\in (1,\infty)$.

Existence of undercompressive travelling waves of a non-local  generalised Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation,"Abstract: We study travelling wave solutions of a generalised Korteweg-de Vries-Burgersequation with a non-local diffusion term and a concave-convex flux. This modelequation arises in the analysis of a shallow water flow by performing formalasymptotic expansions associated to the triple-deck regularisation (which is anextension of classical boundary layer theory). The resulting non-local operatoris a fractional type derivative with order between $1$ and $2$. Travelling wavesolutions are typically analysed in relation to shock formation in the fullshallow water problem. We show rigorously the existence of travelling wavesthat, formally, in the limit of vanishing diffusion and dispersion would giverise to non-classical shocks, that is, shocks that violate the Lax entropycondition. The proof is based on arguments that are typical in dynamicalsystems. The nature of the non-local operator makes this possible, since theresulting travelling wave equation can be seen as a delayedintegro-differential equation. Thus, linearisation around critical points,continuity with respect to parameters and a shooting argument, are the mainsteps that we have proved and adapted for solving this problem.",12/4/2024,"['wavesolutions', 'dynamicalsystems', 'analysed', 'burgersequation', 'modelequation']"

A seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model with $H^1$ vanishing  nonlocality convergence,"Abstract: Based on the development in dealing with nonlocal boundary conditions, wepropose a seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model in this paper. Inour model, a finite constant interaction horizon is equipped in the nonlocalpart and transmission conditions are imposed on a co-dimension one interface.To achieve a seamless coupling, we introduce an auxiliary function to merge thenonlocal model with the local part and design a proper coupling transmissioncondition to ensure the stability and convergence. In addition, by introducingbilinear form, well-posedness of the proposed model can be proved andconvergence to a standard elliptic transmission model with first order in $H^1$norm can be derived.",12/4/2024,"['convergence', 'transmissioncondition', 'introducingbilinear', 'interface', 'diffusion']"
Fast energy decay for damped wave equations with a potential and  rotational inertia terms,"Abstract: We consider damped wave equations with a potential and rotational inertiaterms. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the one dimensionalEuclidean space and we obtain fast energy decay and L^2-decay of the solutionitself as time goes to infinity. Since we are considering this problem in theone dimensional space, we have no useful tools such as the Hardy and/orPoincar\'e inequalities. This causes significant difficulties to derive thedecay property of the solution and the energy. A potential term will play arole for compensating these weak points.",12/4/2024,"['inequalities', 'decay', 'equations', 'abstract', 'inertiaterms']"
A characterisation for the category of Hilbert spaces,"Abstract: The categories of real and of complex Hilbert spaces with bounded linear mapshave received purely categorical characterisations by Chris Heunen and AndreKornell. These characterisations are achieved through Sol\`er's theorem, aresult which shows that certain orthomodularity conditions on a Hermitian spaceover an involutive division ring result in a Hilbert space with the divisionring being either the reals, complexes or quaternions. The characterisation byHeunen and Kornell makes use of a monoidal structure, which in turn excludesthe category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces. We provide an alternativecharacterisation without the assumption of monoidal structure on the category.This new approach not only gives a new characterisation of the categories ofreal and of complex Hilbert spaces, but also the category of quaternionicHilbert spaces.",12/4/2024,"['quaternionichilbert', 'quaternionic', 'hilbert', 'quaternions', 'theorem']"

This leads to the description of the``composition factors'' $S_P$ of $kR_k$, which are parametrized by finite$p$-groups (up to isomorphism), and of the evaluations of these particularsimple diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $k$.",12/5/2024,"['algebraically', 'isomorphism', 'wedescribe', 's_p', 'parametrized']"
Twisted tensor product of dg categories and Kontsevich's Swiss Cheese  conjecture,"Abstract: Let $A$ be a $1$-algebra. The Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture [K2] statesthat the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathrm{Act}(A))$ of actions of$2$-algebras on $A$ has a final object and that this object is weaklyequivalent to the pair $(\mathrm{Hoch}(A), A)$, where $\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$ is thecochain Hochschild complex of $A$. Here the category of actions is the categorywhose objects are pairs $(B,A)$ which are algebras of the chain Swiss Cheeseoperad such that the induced action of the little interval operad on thecomponent $A$ coincides with the $1$-structure on $A$.We prove that there is a colored dg operad ${O}$ with 2 colors, weaklyequivalent to the chain Swiss Cheese operad for which the following ``stricter""version of the Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture holds. Denote the two colorsof ${O}$ by $a$ (for the 1-algebra argument) and $c$ (for the 2-algebraargument), denote by $E_1^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $a$, andby $E_2^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $c$. Let$\mathrm{Alg}({O})$ be the category of dg algebras over ${O}$. For a fixed$1$-algebra $A$ we also have the the category of action $\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A$(equal to $\mathrm{Act}(A)$ in case of the Swiss Cheese operad). We prove thatthere is an equivalence of categories $$\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A \cong\mathrm{Alg}(E_2^{{O}})/\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$$ We stress that for this particularmodel of Swiss Cheese operad the statement holds on the chain level, withoutpassage to the homotopy category.",12/4/2024,"['cheeseoperad', 'cheese', 'swiss', 'algebraargument', 'algebras']"
Generating Higher Identity Proofs in Homotopy Type Theory,"Abstract: Finster and Mimram have defined a dependent type theory called CaTT, whichdescribes the structure of omega-categories. Types in homotopy type theory withtheir higher identity types form weak omega-groupoids, so they are inparticular weak omega-categories. In this article, we show that this principlemakes homotopy type theory into a model of CaTT, by defining a translationprinciple that interprets an operation on the cell of an omega-category as anoperation on higher identity types. We then illustrate how this translationallows to leverage several mechanisation principles that are available in CaTT,to reduce the proof effort required to derive results about the structure ofidentity types, such as the existence of an Eckmann-Hilton cell.",12/2/2024,"['translationprinciple', 'translationallows', 'homotopy', 'principlemakes', 'groupoids']"
The Langlands formula and perverse sheaves,"Abstract: For a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra$\mathfrak{h}$ and Weyl group $W$ we consider the category $\text{Perv}(W\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ of perverse sheaves on $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$smooth w.r.t. the natural stratification. We construct a category$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\text{Perv}(W\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ isidentified with the category of functors from $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ tovector spaces. Objects of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ are labelled by standardparabolic subalgebras in $\mathfrak{g}$. It has morphisms analogous to theoperations of parabolic induction (Eisenstein series) and restriction (constantterm) of automorphic forms. In particular, the Langlands formula for theconstant term of an Eisenstein series has a counterpart in the form of anidentity in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$. We define $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ asthe category of $W$-invariants (in an appropriate sense) in the category $Q$describing perverse sheaves on $\mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the rootarrangement. This matches, in an interesting way, the definition of $W\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ itself as the spectrum of the algebra of$W$-invariants.",12/2/2024,"['algebra', 'mathfrak', 'mathcal', 'eisenstein', 'standardparabolic']"
Categorical approach to graph limits,"Abstract: We define and study a natural category of graph limits. The objects are pairs$(\pi,\mu)$, where $\pi$ (the distribution of vertices) is an abstractprobability measure on some abstract measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and$\mu$ (the distribution of edges) is an abstract finite measure on the square$(X,\mathcal{A})^2$. Morphisms are random maps between the underlyingmeasurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as thedistribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired bys-convergence) for sequences of graph limits.

Approximation of graded bialgebras,"Abstract: Motivated by an equivalence of categories established by Kapranov andSchechtman, we introduce, for each non-negative integer d, the category ofconnected bialgebras modulo d+1. We show that these categories fit into aninverse system of categories whose inverse limit category is equivalent to thecategory of connected bialgebras. In addition, we extend the notion ofapproximation of connected bialgebras to those that are not necessarilygenerated in degree 1 and show that, for connected bialgebras in the categoryof Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra, approximation is compatiblewith cocycle twisting.",11/29/2024,"['algebra', 'drinfeld', 'bialgebras', 'approximation', 'necessarilygenerated']"

Hopf braces and semi-abelian categories,"Abstract: Hopf braces have been introduced as a Hopf-theoretic generalization of skewbraces. Under the assumption of cocommutativity, these algebraic structures areequivalent to matched pairs of actions on Hopf algebras, that can be used toproduce solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We prove that thecategory of cocommutative Hopf braces is semi-abelian and stronglyprotomodular. In particular, this implies that the main homological lemmasknown for groups, Lie algebras and other classical algebraic structures alsohold for cocommutative Hopf braces. Abelian objects are commutative andcocommutative Hopf algebras, that form an abelian Birkhoff subcategory of thecategory of cocommutative Hopf braces. Moreover, we show that the fullsubcategories of ""primitive Hopf braces"" and of ""skew braces"" form anhereditary torsion theory in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces, andthat ""skew braces"" are also a Birkhoff subcategory and a localization of thelatter category. Finally, we describe central extensions and commutators forcocommutative Hopf braces.",11/28/2024,"['algebras', 'forcocommutative', 'algebraic', 'andcocommutative', 'commutative']"
An adjunction theorem for Davydov-Yetter cohomology and infinitesimal  braidings,"Abstract: Davydov-Yetter cohomology $H_{\mathrm{DY}}^{\bullet}(F)$ is associated to amonoidal functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between $\Bbbk$-linearmonoidal categories where $\Bbbk$ is a field, and its second degree classifiesthe infinitesimal deformations of the monoidal structure of $F$. Our mainresult states that if $F$ admits a right adjoint $R$, then there is an object$\Gamma$ in the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ defined in terms of$R$ such that the Davydov-Yetter cohomology of $F$ can be expressed as theDavydov-Yetter cohomology of the identity functor on $\mathcal{C}$ with thecoefficient $\Gamma$. We apply this result in the case when the product functor$\otimes: \mathcal{C} \boxtimes\mathcal{C} \to\mathcal{C}$ has a monoidalstructure given by a braiding $c$ on $\mathcal{C}$ and determine explicitly thecoefficient $\Gamma$ as a coend object in $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}) \boxtimes\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. The motivation is that$H^{\bullet}_{\mathrm{DY}}(\otimes)$ contains a ``space of infinitesimalbraidings tangent to $c$'' in a way that we describe precisely. For$\mathcal{C} = H\text{-}\mathrm{mod}$, where $H$ is a finite-dimensional Hopfalgebra over a field $\Bbbk$, this is the Zariski tangent space to the affinevariety of R-matrices for $H$. In the case of perfect $\Bbbk$, we give adimension formula for this space as an explicit end involving only (low-degree)relative Ext's of the standard adjunction between $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$and $\mathcal{C}$. As a further application of the adjunction theorem, wedescribe deformations of the restriction functor associated to a Hopfsubalgebra and a Drinfeld twist. Both applications are illustrated in theexample of bosonization of exterior algebras.",11/28/2024,"['algebras', 'mathcal', 'cohomology', 'drinfeld', 'theorem']"
Di-Exact Categories and Lattices of Normal Subobjects,"Abstract: The aim of this article is to study certain categorical-algebraic frameworksfor basic homological algebra, introduced in arXiv:2404.15896, with the aim ofbetter understanding the differences between them. We focus on homologicalself-duality, preservation of normal maps by dinversion and diexactness,finding counterexamples that separate any two of these conditions. On the way,we encounter new examples and new characterizations, such as the SecondIsomorphism Property. We also consider homological self-duality in the contextof regular categories. Our main technique is to investigate the lattice ofnormal subobjects of an object in any pointed category with kernels andcokernels. The category of monoidal semilattices is a context where we haveeasy control of these lattices.

The proof involves a new monadicity result for module categories.Lastly, we examine the Hopf case, using Kolb's (2020) notion of aquasitriangular comodule algebra to introduce ""factorizable"" comodule algebras.We then show that the representation category of a quasitriangular comodulealgebra is nondegenerate in our sense precisely when the comodule algebra isfactorizable.

Solvability of Coupled Forward-Backward Volterra Integral Equations,"Abstract: Motivated by the optimality system associated with controlled (forward)Volterra integral equations (FVIEs, for short), the well-posedness of coupledforward-backward Voterra integral equations (FBVIEs, for short) is studied. Themain feature of FBVIEs is that the unknown $\{(X(t,s),Y(t,s))\}$ has twoarguments. By taking $t$ as a parameter and $s$ as a (time) variable, one canregard FBVIE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs, for short),with infinite-dimensional space values$\{(X(\cdot,s),Y(\cdot,s));\,s\in[0,T]\}$. To establish the well-posedness ofsuch an FBVIE, a new non-local monotonicity condition is introduced, by which abridge in infinite-dimensional spaces is constructed. Then by generalizing themethod of continuation developed by \cite{Hu-Peng1995,Yong1997,Peng-Wu1999} fordifferential equations, we have established the well-posedness of FBVIEs.Thekey is to apply the chain rule to the mapping $t\mapsto\big[\int_\cdot^T\langleY(s,s),X(s,\cdot)\rangle ds +\langle G(X(T,T)),X(T,\cdot)\rangle\big](t)$.",12/5/2024,"['equations', 'twoarguments', 'differential', 'peng1995', 'fordifferential']"

Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials arising from hexagon tilings with  3x3-periodic weightings,"Abstract: Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOP) appear in the study of doublyperiodic tiling models. Of particular interest is their limiting behavior asthe degree tends to infinity. In recent years, MVOP associated with doublyperiodic domino tilings of the Aztec diamond have been successfully analyzed.The MVOP related to doubly periodic lozenge tilings of a hexagon are morecomplicated. In this paper we focus on a special subclass of hexagon tilingswith 3x3 periodicity. The special subclass leads to a genus one spectral curvewith additional symmetries that allow us to find an equilibrium measure in anexternal field explicitly. The equilibrium measure gives the asymptoticdistribution for the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The associatedg-functions appear in the strong asymptotic formula for the MVOP that we obtainfrom a steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for MVOP.",12/4/2024,"['riemann', 'polynomials', 'diamond', 'tilingswith', 'tilings']"
Deformations of singularities of meromorphic  $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections and meromorphic quadratic  differentials,"Abstract: This paper contributes to the theory of singularities of meromorphic linearODEs in traceless $2\times2$ cases, focusing on their deformations andconfluences.It is divided into two parts:The first part addresses individual singularities without imposingrestrictions on their type or degeneracy. The main result establishes acorrespondence between local formal invariants and jets of meromorphicquadratic differentials. This result is then utilized to describe the parameterspace of universal isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections over Riemann surfaces.The second part examines the confluence of singularities in a fully generalsetting, accommodating all forms of degeneracies. It explores the relationshipbetween the geometry of the unfolded Stokes phenomenon and the horizontal andvertical foliations of parametric families of quadratic differentials. Thelocal moduli space is naturally identified with a specific space of localmonodromy and Stokes data, presented as a space of representations of certainfundamental groupoids associated with the foliations.

Hyperdeterminantal Total Positivity,"Abstract: For a given positive integer $m$, the concept of {\it hyperdeterminantaltotal positivity} is defined for a kernel $K:\R^{2m} \to \R$, therebygeneralizing the classical concept of total positivity. Extending thefundamental example, $K(x,y) = \exp(xy)$, $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, of a classicaltotally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property ofthe kernel $K(x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}) = \exp(x_1\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}\in \mathbb{R}$ is established. A hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy argument isapplied to derive a generalization of Karlin's Basic Composition Formula, fromwhich several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels areconstructed.

Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis  and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets  simultaneously,"Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrizedfamily of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ ofmeasures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H\Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu\in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of$\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We alsoprove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almostevery $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e.$x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can includefamilies of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal,non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contractingconformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying thetransversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has$\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)}\}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similaritydimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translationsthe multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval$\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\logp_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theoremholds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on aself-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without anyseparation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.",12/4/2024,"['mathbb', 'theorem', 'lambda_i', 'lambda', 'mathrm']"
Self-improvement of fractional Hardy inequalities in metric measure  spaces via hyperbolic fillings,"Abstract: In this paper, we prove a self-improvement result for $(\theta,p)$-fractionalHardy inequalities, in both the exponent $1<p<\infty$ and the regularityparameter $0<\theta<1$, for bounded domains in doubling metric measure spaces.The key conceptual tool is a Caffarelli-Silvestre-type argument, which relatesfractional Sobolev spaces on $Z$ to Newton-Sobolev spaces in the hyperbolicfilling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$ of $Z$ via trace results. Using thisinsight, it is shown that a fractional Hardy inequality in an open subset of$Z$ is equivalent to a classical Hardy inequality in the filling$\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$. The main result is then obtained by applying anew weighted self-improvement result for $p$-Hardy inequalities. The exponent$p$ can be self-improved by a classical Koskela-Zhong argument, but a newtheory of regularizable weights is developed to obtain the self-improvement inthe regularity parameter $\theta$. This generalizes a result of Lehrb\""ack andKoskela on self-improvement of $d_\Omega^\beta$-weighted $p$-Hardy inequalitiesby allowing a much broader class of weights. Using the equivalence offractional Hardy inequalities with Hardy inequalities in the fillings, we alsogive new examples of domains satisfying fractional Hardy inequalities.",12/3/2024,"['regularityparameter', 'newton', 'doubling', 'theta', 'metric']"
On entangled and multi-parameter commutators,"Abstract: We complement the recent theory of general singular integrals $T$ invariantunder the Zygmund dilations $(x_1, x_2, x_3) \mapsto (s x_1, tx_2, st x_3)$ byproving necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactnessof commutators $[b,T]$ from $L^p \to L^q$. Previously, only the $p=q$ upperbound in terms of a Zygmund type little $\operatorname{BMO}$ space was knownfor general operators, and it appears that there has been some confusion aboutthe corresponding lower bound in recent literature. We give completecharacterizations whenever $p \le q$ for a general class of non-degenerateZygmund type singular integrals. Some of the results are somewhat surprising inview of existing papers - for instance, compactness always forces $b$ to beconstant. Even in the simpler situation of bi-parameter singular integrals itappears that this has not been observed previously.",12/3/2024,"['completecharacterizations', 'invariantunder', 'integrals', 'commutators', 'boundedness']"

In this paper, we analyze the series expansions of$-x_k(q)/k$ and $k/x_k(q)$ in powers of $q$. We prove that the coefficients ofthese expansions are rational functions of the form $P_n(k)/Q_n(k)$ and$\widehat{P}_n(k)/Q_n(k)$, where $Q_n(k) \in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ is explicitlydefined and the polynomials $P_n(k), \widehat{P}_n(k)\in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ can becomputed recursively. We provide explicit formulas for the leading coefficientsof $P_n(k)$ and $\widehat{P}_n(k)$ and compute the coefficients of thesepolynomials for $n \leq 300$. Numerical verification shows that $P_n(k)$ and$\widehat{P}_n(k)$ take non-negative values for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and$n\le 300$, offering further evidence in support of conjectures by Alan Sokal.",12/3/2024,"['polynomials', 'mathbb', 'formulas', 'q_n', 'exponential']"
A multiplicity result for Hamiltonian systems with mixed periodic-type  and Neumann-type boundary conditions boundary conditions,"Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity of solutions for a Hamiltonian systemcoupling two systems associated with mixed boundary conditions.

Explicit evaluation of the $q$-Stokes matrices for certain confluent  hypergeometric $q$-difference equations,"Abstract: We prove a connection formula for the basic hypergeomtric function${}_n\varphi_{n-1}\left(a_1,...,a_{n-1},0;b_1,...,b_{n-1}; q, z\right)$ by using the $q$-Borel resummation. As an application, wecompute $q$-Stokes matrices of a special confluent hypergeometric$q$-difference system with an irregular singularity. We show that by letting$q\rightarrow 1$, the $q$-Stokes matrices recover the known expressions of theStokes matrices of the corresponding confluent hypergeometric differentialsystem.",12/3/2024,"['varphi_', 'hypergeometric', 'hypergeomtric', 'differentialsystem', 'matrices']"
Self-embedding similitudes of Bedford-McMullen carpets with dependent  ratios,"Abstract: We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allowoblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending thecarpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallelto one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurabilityresult on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previousstudy of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. & Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] onBedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents,together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinskicarpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and henceallows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that ifa generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition andpermits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent ofthe rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.",12/3/2024,"['carpet', 'carpets', 'allowoblique', 'sierpinskicarpet', 'logarithmic']"

Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic  gradient descent,"Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descentmethod termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD)method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standardassumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the methodconverges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we firstpropose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggestedby Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR.Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring anya-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates infinitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features.Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known sourceand other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. Tothe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both theregularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient methodusing a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbertspaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practicalefficacy of the proposed method.",12/3/2024,"['hilbertspaces', 'hilbert', 'methodconverges', 'descentmethod', 'methodusing']"

Harmonic analysis in Dunkl settings,"Abstract: Let $L$ be the Dunkl Laplacian on the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^N$associated with a normalized root $R$ and a multiplicity function $k(\nu)\ge 0,\nu\in R$. In this paper, we first prove that the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkinspaces associated with the Dunkl Laplacian $L$ are identical to the Besov andTriebel-Lizorkin spaces defined in the space of homogeneous type $(\mathbb R^N,\|\cdot\|, dw)$, where $dw({\rm x})=\prod_{\nu\in R}\langle \nu,{\rmx}\rangle^{k(\nu)}d{\rm x}$. Next, consider the Dunkl transform denoted by$\mathcal{F}$. We introduce the multiplier operator $T_m$, defined as $T_mf =\mathcal{F}^{-1}(m\mathcal{F}f)$, where $m$ is a bounded function defined on$\mathbb{R}^N$. Our second aim is to prove multiplier theorems, including theH\""ormander multiplier theorem, for $T_m$ on the Besov and Tribel-Lizorkinspaces in the space of homogeneous type $(\mathbb R^N, \|\cdot\|, dw)$.Importantly, our findings present novel results, even in the specific case ofthe Hardy spaces.",12/2/2024,"['mathbb', 'euclidean', 'mathcal', 'theorems', 'theorem']"

Convergence of (generalized) power series solutions of functional  equations,"Abstract: Solutions of nonlinear functional equations are generally not expressed as afinite number of combinations and compositions of elementary and known specialfunctions. One of the approaches to study them is, firstly, to find formalsolutions (that is, series whose terms are described and ordered in some waybut which do not converge apriori) and, secondly, to study the convergence orsummability of these formal solutions (the existence and uniqueness of actualsolutions with the given asymptotic expansion in a certain domain). In thispaper we deal only with the convergence of formal functional series having theform of an infinite sum of power functions with (complex, in general) powerexponents and satisfying analytical functional equations of the following threetypes: a differential, $q$-difference or Mahler equation.",12/1/2024,"['nonlinear', 'equations', 'specialfunctions', 'powerexponents', 'asymptotic']"

As a consequence,several properties of $P_n (x; z)$ concerning the coefficients $\gamma_n (z)$in the three-term recurrence relation they satisfy as well as the moments andthe Stieltjes function of $\mathbf{u}$ are studied. Ladder operators associatedwith such a linear functional and the holonomic equation that the polynomials$P_n (x; z)$ satisfy are deduced.

On Local Irregularity Conjecture for 2-multigraphs,"Abstract: A multigraph in which adjacent vertices have different degrees is calledlocally irregular. The locally irregular edge coloring is an edge coloring of amultigraph $G$ in which every color induces a locally irregular submultigraphof $G$. We denote by $\operatorname{lir}(G)$ the locally irregular chromaticindex of a multigraph $G$, which is the smallest number of colors required in alocally irregular edge coloring of $G$, given that such a coloring of $G$exists. By $^2G$ we denote a 2-multigraph obtained from a simple graph $G$ bydoubling each its edge. In 2022 Grzelec and Wo\'zniak conjectured that$\operatorname{lir}(^2G) \leq 2$ for every connected simple graph $G$ differentfrom $K_2$; the conjecture is known as Local Irregularity Conjecture for2-multigraphs. In this paper, we prove this conjecture in the case of regulargraphs, split graphs, and some particular families of subcubic graphs.Moreover, we provide a constant upper bound on the locally irregular chromaticindex of planar 2-multigraphs (except for $^2K_2$), and we obtain a betterconstant upper bound on $\operatorname{lir}(^2G)$ if $G$ is a simple subcubicgraph different from $K_2$. In the proofs, special decompositions of graphs andthe relation of Local Irregularity Conjecture to the well-known 1-2-3Conjecture are utilized.",12/5/2024,"['coloring', 'graphs', 'graph', 'vertices', 'conjecture']"

The$d$-dimensional discrepancy of the tree $T$ is the minimum, over all functions$f$ as above, of the maximum imbalance of a subtree of $T$.

Variants of the WalkSATalgorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos andSt\""utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running timeof WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances.

Further analysis on the second frequency of union-closed set families,"Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, askswhether, for any union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ with $m$ sets, there isan element that lies in at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot m$ sets in $\mathcal{F}$. In2022, Nagel posed a stronger conjecture that within any union-closed familywhose ground set size is at least $k$, there are always $k$ elements in theground set that appear in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1}+1}$ proportion of the setsin the family.Das and Wu showed that this conjecture is true for $k\geq 3$ and $k=2$ if$|\mathcal{F}|$ is outside a particular range.

Partial Betti splittings with applications to binomial edge ideals,"Abstract: We introduce the notion of a partial Betti splitting of a homogeneous ideal,generalizing the notion of a Betti splitting first given by Francisco, H\`a,and Van Tuyl. Given a homogeneous ideal $I$ and two ideals $J$ and $K$ suchthat $I = J+K$, a partial Betti splitting of $I$ relates some of the gradedBetti of $I$ with those of $J, K$, and $J\cap K$. As an application, we focuson the partial Betti splittings of binomial edge ideals. Using this newtechnique, we generalize results of Saeedi Madani and Kiani related to binomialedge ideals with cut edges, we describe a partial Betti splitting for allbinomial edge ideals, and we compute the total second Betti number of binomialedge ideals of trees.",12/5/2024,"['newtechnique', 'binomialedge', 'gradedbetti', 'binomial', 'generalizing']"
Robust Contraction Decomposition for Minor-Free Graphs and its  Applications,"Abstract: We prove a robust contraction decomposition theorem for $H$-minor-freegraphs, which states that given an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ and an integer $p$,one can partition in polynomial time the vertices of $G$ into $p$ sets$Z_1,\dots,Z_p$ such that $\operatorname{tw}(G/(Z_i \setminus Z')) = O(p +|Z'|)$ for all $i \in [p]$ and $Z' \subseteq Z_i$. Here,$\operatorname{tw}(\cdot)$ denotes the treewidth of a graph and $G/(Z_i\setminus Z')$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edgeswith both endpoints in $Z_i \setminus Z'$.Our result generalizes earlier results by Klein [SICOMP 2008] and Demaine etal. [STOC 2011] based on partitioning $E(G)$, and some recent theorems forplanar graphs by Marx et al. [SODA 2022], for bounded-genus graphs (moregenerally, almost-embeddable graphs) by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SODA 2022], andfor unit-disk graphs by Bandyapadhyay et al.

Consequently, we obtain the firstsubexponential-time parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set,Subset Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, 2-ConnComponent Order Connectivity on $H$-minor-free graphs. For other problems whichalready have subexponential-time parameterized algorithms on $H$-minor-freegraphs (e.g., Odd Cycle Transversal, Vertex Multiway Cut, Vertex Multicut,etc.), our theorem gives much simpler algorithms of the same running time.",12/5/2024,"['polynomial', 'graphs', 'algorithms', 'theorems', 'theorem']"

A sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture and an  application to rounding fractional covers,"Abstract: Expectation thresholds arise from a class of integer linear programs (LPs)that are fundamental to the study of thresholds in large random systems. Anavenue towards estimating expectation thresholds comes from the fractionalrelaxation of these integer LPs, which yield the fractional expectationthresholds. Regarding the gap between the integer LPs and their fractionalrelaxations, Talagrand made a bold conjecture, that the integral and fractionalexpectation thresholds are within a constant factor of each other. In otherwords, any small fractional solution can be ``rounded''.In this paper, we prove a strong upper bound on the expectation thresholdstarting from a fractional solution supported on sets with small size. Inparticular, this resolves Talagrand's conjecture for fractional solutionssupported on sets with bounded size. Our key input for rounding the fractionalsolutions is a sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture that isof independent interest.",12/4/2024,"['integer', 'fractionalrelaxations', 'fractionalsolutions', 'fractionalexpectation', 'fractionalrelaxation']"
Pin classes II: Small pin classes,"Abstract: Pin permutations play an important role in the structural study ofpermutation classes, most notably in relation to simple permutations andwell-quasi-ordering, and in enumerative consequences arising from these. Inthis paper, we continue our study of pin classes, which are permutation classesthat comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pinpermutation. We show that there is a phase transition at $\mu\approx 3.28277$:there are uncountably many different pin classes whose growth rate is equal to$\mu$, yet only countably many below $\mu$. Furthermore, by showing that allpin classes with growth rate less than $\mu$ are essentially defined by pinpermutations that possess a periodic structure, we classify the set of growthrates of pin classes up to $\mu$.",12/4/2024,"['pinpermutations', 'pinpermutation', 'ofpermutation', '28277', 'infinite']"

We prove that $\tau = \mathcal{O}(n^{1 -1/t})$ which confirms their conjecture and is best possible assuming the widelybelieved conjecture that $\operatorname{ex}(n, K_{t, t}) = \Theta(n^{2 -1/t})$.

The Herzog-Takayama resolution over a skew polynomial ring,"Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be a field, and let $I$ be a monomial ideal in the polynomialring $R=\Bbbk[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. In her thesis, Taylor introduced a complex thatprovides a finite free resolution of $R/I$ as an $R$-module. Building on this,Ferraro, Martin and Moore extended this construction to monomial ideals in skewpolynomial rings. Since the Taylor resolution is generally not minimal,significant effort has been devoted to identifying classes of ideals withminimal free resolutions that are relatively straightforward to construct. In a1987 paper, Eliahou and Kervaire developed a minimal free resolution for aclass of monomial ideals in $R$ known as stable ideals. This result was latergeneralized to stable ideals in skew polynomial rings by Ferraro and Hardesty.In a 2002 paper, Herzog and Takayama constructed a minimal free resolution formonomial ideals with linear quotients, a broader class of ideals containingstable ideals. Their resolution reduces to the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution inthe stable case. In this paper, we generalize the Herzog-Takayama resolution toskew polynomial rings.",12/4/2024,"['polynomialring', 'polynomial', 'herzog', 'taylor', 'a1987']"

Twisted Derivations in Algebraic Number Fields,"Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity and $B = A[\theta]$ be an integralextension of $A$. Assume that $B$ is an integral domain with quotient field$\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the minimal splitting field of $\theta$ over$\mathbb{K}$. Suppose $\sigma, \tau: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ are twodifferent ring homomorphisms that fix $A$ element-wise. In this article, weclassify all $A$-linear maps $D: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ which are $(\sigma,\tau)$-derivations. Consequently, we classify all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivationsin certain field extensions, algebraic number fields, and their ring ofalgebraic integers. For the ring of algebraic integers, $O_{\mathbb{K}} =\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{K} =\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($\zeta$ an $n^{\text{th}}$ primitive root of unity), and apair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of two different $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra endomorphisms of$O_{\mathbb{K}}$, we conjecture a necessary and sufficient condition for a$(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D:O_{\mathbb{K}} \rightarrow O_{\mathbb{K}}$ to beinner.

"$(σ, τ)$-Derivations of Number Rings","Abstract: In this article, we study $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of number rings byconsidering them as commutative unital $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We begin bycharacterizing all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma,\tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers of a quadratic numberfield. Then we characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring ofalgebraic integers $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of a $p^{\text{th}}$-cyclotomic numberfield $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($p$ odd rational prime and $\zeta$ a primitive$p^{\text{th}}$-root of unity). We also conjecture (using SAGE and MATLAB) an\enquote{if and only if} condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D$ on$\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ to be inner. We further characterize all $(\sigma,\tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the bi-quadraticnumber ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{n}]$ ($m$, $n$ distinct square-freerational integers). In each of the above cases, we also determine the rank andan explicit basis of the derivation algebra consisting of all $(\sigma,\tau)$-derivations of the number ring.",12/4/2024,"['algebras', 'integers', 'algebra', 'quadraticnumber', 'quadratic']"

Weapply these test behaviour, along with other results, to characterize variouskinds of local rings, including hypersurface rings of multiplicity at most two,via finite vanishing of Ext or Tor involving such CM modules.

We find sufficient conditions for uniform dominance, by which weshow Burch rings and local rings with quasi-decomposable maximal ideal areuniformly dominant. For a uniformly dominant excellent equicharacteristicisolated singularity, we get an upper bound of the Orlov spectrum of thesingularity category. We prove uniform dominance is preserved under basicoperations, and give techniques to construct uniformly dominant local rings.

Goldbach Theorems for Group Semidomains,"Abstract: A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. We call a semidomain $S$additively reduced if $0$ is the only invertible element of the monoid $(S,+)$, while we say that $S$ is additively Furstenberg if every non-invertibleelement of $(S,+)$ can be expressed as the sum of an atom and an element of$S$. In this paper, we study a variant of the Goldbach conjecture within theframework of group semidomains $S[G]$ and group series semidomains$S[\![G]\!]$, where $S$ is both an additively reduced and additivelyFurstenberg semidomain and $G$ is a torsion-free abelian group. In particular,we show that every non-constant polynomial expression in $S[G]$ can be writtenas the sum of at most two irreducibles if and only if the condition$\mathscr{A}_+(S) = S^\times$ holds.",11/30/2024,"['additivelyfurstenberg', 'abelian', 'polynomial', 'mathscr', 'additively']"

As such, this is a variant on theorems of Raynaud \&Hironaka, but it's functorial nature allows its application to a flatteningtheorem for formal algebraic spaces or Artin champs, where we apply it to proveclose to optimal algebrisation theorems for formal deformations.

On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves,"Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curvesfrom a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understandthe intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. Theproperties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed,highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties.Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersectionmonomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog andKunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given byDelorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectivespresent in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances thatshow an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexanderpolynomials of knots.

Automorphisms of subalgebras of bounded analytic functions,"Abstract: Let $H^\infty$ denotes the algebra of all bounded analytic functions on theunit disk.

In this article, we give verysimple proof of their results. As an interesting generalization, for any$\psi\in H^\infty$, we show that every automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ must bea composition operator and characterize all such composition operators. Usingthis characterization, we find all automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ for fewchoices of $\psi$ with various nature depending on its zeros.",12/4/2024,"['algebra', 'math', '2024', '127698', 'maurya']"

Bigness of adjoint linear subsystem and approximation theorems with  ideal sheaves on weakly pseudoconvex manifolds,"Abstract: Let $X$ be a weakly pseudoconvex manifold and $L\longrightarrow X$ be aholomorphic line bundle with a singular positive Hermitian metric $h$. In thisarticle, we provide a points separation theorem and an embedding for theadjoint linear subsystem including the multiplier ideal sheaf$\mathscr{I}(h^m)$, with respect to an appropriate set excluding a singularlocus of $h$. We also show that the adjoint bundle of $L$ is big. To handleanalytical methods, we first establish an approximation of singular Hermitianmetrics on relatively compact subsets from Demailly's approximation thatpreserves ideal sheaves and is compatible with blow-ups. Using the blow-upsobtained from this approximation, we provide the embedding and big-ness for theadjoint bundle $K_X\otimes L^{\otimes m}\otimes\mathscr{I}(h^m)$ on eachsublevel set $X_c$, and a singular holomorphic Morse inequality including idealsheaves. Furthermore, we establish the approximation theorem for holomorphicsections of the adjoint bundle including the multiplier ideal sheaf, i.e.$K_X\otimes L\otimes\mathscr{I}(h)$, as a key result in the process ofglobalizing. Using these results, we can achieve points separation on each$X_c\setminus Z_c$, where $Z_c$ is an analytic subset obtained as a singularlocus of the approximation, and then globalize this to provide embeddings.Finally, as an application of this blow-ups, we present a global singularNakano vanishing theorem.",12/2/2024,"['mathscr', 'theorem', 'hermitianmetrics', 'holomorphicsections', 'manifold']"

"Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic  functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local  stable/unstable curves","Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking NewQ-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to findroots of meromorphic functions.If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with$deg (P)>deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set$\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of realanalytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statementsA and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with aninitial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to aroot of $f$.B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point -but not a root - of $f$.Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial,the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analyticcurves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ iscontained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holdsfor general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we donot require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphicfunction $f$ is generic.Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously andheuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works bythe authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (anddifferences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.",12/3/2024,"['polynomials', 'mathbf', 'analyticcurves', 'mathcal', 'polynomial']"

In this paper, we relax the condition that $f(z)$ and$g(z)$ are of the same degree and instead assume that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ arepolynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ and $m$ respectively, $m\leq n,$ and obtaina generalization of this result.

One important object used in the construction of geodesicnets is a balanced vertex, where the sum of unit tangent vectors along adjacentedges is zero. In 2021, Parsch proved the upper bound for the number ofbalanced vertices of a geodesic net with three unbalanced vertices on surfaceswith non-positive curvature. We extend his result by proving the existence of abalanced vertex of a triangle (with three unbalanced vertices) on anytwo-dimensional surface when all angles measure less than $2\pi/3$, if thelength of the sides of the triangle are not too large.

On Third-Order Evolution Systems Describing Pseudo-Spherical or  Spherical Surfaces,"Abstract: We consider a class of third-order evolution equations of the form\begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyleu_{t}=F\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),\displaystylev_{t}=G\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),\end{array}\right. \end{equation*} describing pseudos-pherical (\textbf{pss}) orspherical surfaces (\textbf{ss}), meaning that, their generic solutions$(u(x,t), v(x,t))$ provide metrics, with coordinates $(x,t)$, on open subsetsof the plane, with constant curvature $K=-1$ or $K=1$. These systems can bedescribed as the integrability conditions of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued linearproblems, with $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R)$ or$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{su}(2)$, when $K=-1$, $K=1$, respectively. We obtaincharacterization and also classification results.

From Kähler Ricci solitons to Calabi-Yau Kähler cones,"Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\""ahler Riccisoliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complexprojective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. Thiscan be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa.This result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ overthe momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-solitonexists.

On translocal entropy functions,"Abstract: In 2007, Ye \& Zhang introduced a version of local topological entropy. Sincetheir entropy function is, as we show under mild conditions, constant fortopologically transitive dynamical systems, we propose to adjust the notion ina way that doesn't neglect the initial transient part of an orbit.We investigate the properties of this ``transient'' local entropy and computeit in terms of Lyapunov exponents for various dynamical systems.We also investigate how this adjustment affects measure-theoretic local(Brin-Katok) entropy.",12/5/2024,"['2007', 'topological', 'orbit', 'adjustment', 'theoretic']"
Subsystem Resetting of a Heterogeneous Network of Theta Neurons,"Abstract: Stochastic resetting has shown promise in enhancing the stability ofdynamical systems. Here, we apply this concept to theta neuron networks withpartial resetting, where only a fraction of neurons is intermittently reset. Weexamine both infinite and finite reset rates, using the averaged firing rate asan indicator of network stability. At infinite reset rates, a high proportionof resetting neurons drives the network to stable rest or spiking states,collapsing the bistable region at the Cusp bifurcation and producing smoothtransitions. Finite resetting introduces stochastic fluctuations, leading tocomplex dynamics that sometimes deviate from theoretical predictions. Theseinsights highlight the role of partial resetting in stabilizing neuraldynamics, with applications in biological systems and neuromorphic computing.",12/5/2024,"['neuraldynamics', 'smoothtransitions', 'stabilizing', 'neuromorphic', 'neurons']"
Mostly contracting random maps,"Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the iteration of a random map consistingof Lipschitz transformations on a compact metric space, independently andrandomly selected according to a fixed probability measure. Such a random mapis said to be \emph{mostly contracting} if all Lyapunov exponents associatedwith stationary measures are negative. This requires introducing the notion of(maximal) Lyapunov exponent in this general context of Lipschitztransformations on compact metric spaces. We show that this class is open withrespect to the appropriate topology and satisfies the strong law of largenumbers for non-uniquely ergodic systems, the limit theorem for the law ofrandom iterations, the global Palis' conjecture, and that the associatedannealed Koopman operator is quasi-compact. This implies many statisticalproperties such as central limit theorems, large deviations, statisticalstability, and the continuity and H\""older continuity of Lyapunov exponents.Examples from this class of random maps include random products of circle$C^1$ diffeomorphisms, interval $C^1$ diffeomorphisms onto their images, and$C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a Cantor set on a line, all considered under theassumption of no common invariant measure. This class also includes projectiveactions of locally constant linear cocycles under the assumptions of simplicityof the first Lyapunov exponent and some kind of irreducibility.One of the main tools to prove the above results is the generalization ofKingman's subadditive ergodic theorem and the uniform Kingman's subadditiveergodic theorem for general Markov operators. These results are of independentinterest, as they may have broad applications in other contexts.",12/4/2024,"['topology', 'theorems', 'markov', 'theorem', 'statisticalproperties']"
Approximately Jumping Towards the Origin,"Abstract: Given an initial point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and a sequence of vectors $v_1,v_2, \dots$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we define a greedy sequence by setting $x_{n} =x_{n-1} \pm v_n$ where the sign is chosen so as to minimize $\|x_n\|$. We provethat if the vectors $v_i$ are chosen uniformly at random from$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ then elements of the sequence are, on average, approximatelyat distance $\|x_n\| \sim \sqrt{\pi d/8}$ from the origin. We show that thesequence $(\|x_n\|)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has an invariant measure $\pi_d$ dependingonly on $d$ and we determine its mean and study its decay for all $d$. We alsoinvestigate a completely deterministic example in $d=2$ where the $v_n$ arederived from the van der Corput sequence. Several additional examples areconsidered.",12/5/2024,"['mathbb', 'pi_d', 'alsoinvestigate', 'x_n', 'x_0']"
Optimal Low-Thrust Orbit Transfers Connecting Gateway with Earth and  Moon,"Abstract: Gateway will represent a primary logistic infrastructure in cislunar space.The identification of efficient orbit transfers capable of connecting Earth,Moon, and Gateway paves the way for enabling refurbishment, servicing, andutilization of this orbiting platform. This study is devoted to determiningtwo-way minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers that connect both Earth andMoon to Gateway. Backward time propagation is proposed as a very convenientoption for trajectories that approach and rendezvous with Gateway, and aunified formulation is introduced for minimum-time orbit transfers, usingeither forward or backward propagation. Two-way transfers between Gateway and aspecified low-altitude lunar orbit are first determined, using an indirectheuristic method, which employs the necessary conditions for optimality and aheuristic algorithm. Second, two-way orbit transfers that connect Earth andGateway are addressed. Because these trajectories exist under the influence oftwo major attracting bodies, the underlying optimal control problem isformulated as a multi-arc trajectory optimization problem, involving threedifferent representations for the spacecraft state. Multi-arc optimal controlproblems are associated with several corner conditions to be enforced at thejunction time that separates distinct arcs. However, these conditions are shownto be solvable sequentially for the problem at hand, leveraging implicitcostate transformation. This implies that the multi-arc problem has a set ofunknown quantities with the same size as that of a single-arc optimal controlproblem, with apparent advantages of computational nature. The indirectheuristic method is also applied in this second mission scenario.",12/5/2024,"['spacecraft', 'orbit', 'moon', 'lunar', 'space']"
Neuromodulation and homeostasis: complementary mechanisms for robust  neural function,"Abstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis andneuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasisstabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereasneuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to externalsignals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often producesunreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes withhomeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspiredneuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliableneuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion anddopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preservesneuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlikesharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integratesactivity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupledreceptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically dependson the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing abalance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns.Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections,enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We furthershow that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliablymodulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggestthat targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-mayoffer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. Thisstudy highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation,proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptiveneural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.",12/5/2024,"['inspiredneuromodulation', 'neuromodulation', 'andneuromodulation', 'neuromodulated', 'reliableneuronal']"
On multiplicative recurrence along linear patterns,"Abstract: In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrencefor actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and providedsome sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in\mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary conditionfor $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completelymultiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that$\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fullycharacterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latterproperty. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerningthe pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun.

Persistence/extinction scenarios in an almost periodic metapopulation  with competition and habitat destruction,"Abstract: We study an almost periodic version of a metapopulation model developed byTilman \textit{et.al} and Nee \textit{et.al} in the nineties, which generalizesthe classical Levins approach by considering several species in competitionaffected by habitat destruction. The novelty is to assume that the colonizationand extinction rates are positive almost periodic functions whereas our mainresults show that the predominance of either colonization or extinction forcesof a specific species is equivalent to the property of exponential dichotomy ofa scalar linear differential equation. By using well known results ofexponential dichotomy theory, we carry out a recursive and exhaustivedescription of persistence/extinction scenarios. In addition, we start apreliminary discussion describing a more elusive behavior when the colonizationand extinction forces are similar in average.",12/4/2024,"['competitionaffected', 'exhaustivedescription', 'metapopulation', 'colonizationand', 'nineties']"
Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear  Systems,"Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years foridentifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into aninfinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stabilityguarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially underconditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge withinthe existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, wepropose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field andLyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount ofdata sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relativelylow sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developedhigh-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient systemtransitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunovfunctions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verifiedusing a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide lessconservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existingmethods.",12/3/2024,"['algorithmic', 'lyapunovfunctions', 'physics', 'learning', 'nonlinear']"
Multidimensional Opinion Dynamics with Heterogeneous Bounded Confidences  and Random Interactions,"Abstract: This paper introduces a heterogeneous multidimensional bounded confidence(BC) opinion dynamics with random pairwise interactions, whereby each pair ofagents accesses each other's opinions with a specific probability. This revisedmodel is motivated by the observation that the standard Hegselmann-Krause (HK)dynamics requires unrealistic all-to-all interactions at certainconfigurations. For this randomized BC opinion dynamics, regardless of initialopinions and positive confidence bounds, we show that the agents' statesconverge to fixed final opinions in finite time almost surely and that theconvergence rate follows a negative exponential distribution in mean square.Furthermore, we establish sufficient conditions for the heterogeneous BCopinion dynamics with random interactions to achieve consensus in finite time.",11/28/2024,"['revisedmodel', 'initialopinions', 'randomized', 'certainconfigurations', 'probability']"
Mean dimension theory for infinite dimensional Bedford-McMullen sponges,"Abstract: Tsukamoto (2022) introduced the notion of Bedford-McMullen carpet system, asubsystem of $([0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}\times[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ whose metricmean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension does not coincide in general. Theaim of this paper is to develop the mean dimension theory for Bedford-McMullensponge system, which is a subsystem of $(([0,1]^r)^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ witharbitrary $3\leq r\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the metric meandimension and mean Hausdorff dimension of such topological dynamical systemsexplicitly, extending the results by Tsukamoto. The metric mean dimension is aweighted combination of the standard topological entropy, whereas the meanHausdorff dimension is expressed in terms of weighted topological entropy. Wealso exhibit a special situation for which the metric mean dimension and themean Hausdorff dimension of a sponge system coincide.",12/3/2024,"['2022', 'mathbb', 'metricmean', 'mcmullensponge', 'carpet']"

Energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification of clearance  nonlinearities,"Abstract: The energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification (EDDI) method is a newdata-driven technique for the discovery of equations of motion (EOMs) ofstrongly nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators. This researchuses the EDDI method to obtain mathematical models for SDOF systems withclearance nonlinearities. The first key aspect of the EDDI method is that itrelates the kinetic energy of the system to the dissipated energy and theunderlying non-conservative forces acting on the oscillator. The second keyaspect is that the EOM is identified with only knowledge of the mass of theoscillator and the transient response. The first phase of the EDDI methodconstructs the dissipated energy from the kinetic energy, then identifies amathematical model for the damping based on the dissipated energy. To achievethis, the moments in time when the displacements are zero, where the mechanicaland kinetic energies are equal, are used to compute the energy dissipated bythe damping of the system. The second phase begins by computing theconservative force acting on the oscillator from either a balance of the otherforces in the system or through the Lagrange equation. Finally, the stiffnessmodel is determined by solving a set of linear equations to construct amathematical model for the conservative (elastic) force. The governingequations are discovered by incorporating both the damping and stiffness terms.The method is demonstrated by employing analytical and real measured responsesof nonlinear SDOF systems with different clearances nonlinearities, which showsthat the proposed approach is suitable for non-smooth mechanical systems aswell as smooth systems.",12/2/2024,"['newdata', 'mathematical', 'researchuses', 'methodconstructs', 'discovery']"
On the Defense of the Recent Solution to Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem:  Clarifying Misinterpretations and the Incorrect Conclusions in Buzzi and  Novaes's note,"Abstract: Recently, the covariant formulation of the geometric bifurcation theory,developed in a previous paper, has been applied to two elementary problems: thestudy of limit cycles of dynamical systems and the second part of Hilbert'ssixteenth problem. First, it has been shown that dynamical systems with morethan one limit cycle are understood to be those in which the scalar curvature$\mbox{R}$ is positive and its magnitude diverges to infinity at differentsingular points. In the second, it has been demonstrated that $n$th-degreepolynomial systems have the maximum number of $2(n-1)(4(n-1)-2)$ limit cycleswith their relative positions determined by the singularities of the magnitudeof $\mbox{R}$, thus providing a successful response to the original Hilbert'schallenge. It is the purpose of this letter to point out that Buzzi andNovaes's note is incorrect and leads to erroneous results as an immediateconsequence of their superficial reading of our work, the omission of criticalaspects of the GBT to induce doubt, and reliance on incorrect assumptions orinterpretations that deviate from those established in the framework of GBT.",12/2/2024,"['hilbert', 'degreepolynomial', 'andnovaes', 'curvature', 'cycleswith']"

Asymptically full measure sets of almost-periodic solutions for the NLS  equation,"Abstract: We study the global dynamics of solutions to a family of nonlinearSchr\""odinger %(NLS) equations on the circle, with a smooth convolutionpotential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the constructionof an asymptotically full measure set of time almost-periodic solutions, whosehulls are invariant tori. Specifically, we show that for most choices of theconvolution potential there exists a bi-Lipschitz map from a ball in the spaceof linear solutions to the space of initial data, such that all linearsolutions with frequencies satisfying a non-resonance condition are mapped toinitial data giving rise to an almost-periodic solution. As a consequence, weestablish that the Gevrey norm of many initial data remains approximatelyconstant in time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunovstatistically stable with respect to such a norm. Furthermore, we construct aCantor foliation of the phase space, where regions corresponding to positiveactions are foliated by invariant maximal tori. This result generalizes theclassical KAM theory in the infinite-dimensional setting, providing astatistical description of the global dynamics near the fixed point. Our worksuggests that diffusive solutions should be looked for in spaces of lowerregularity, in line with recent findings in the theory of Hamiltonian PDEs",12/3/2024,"['equations', 'lyapunovstatistically', 'hamiltonian', 'linearsolutions', 'elliptic']"

Next, with the aid of the optimal inequality, we classify theexistence of ground states to stationary MFGs with Hartree-type coupling interms of the $L^1$-norm of population density defined by $M$. In addition,under certain types of coercive potentials, the asymptotics of ground states toergodic MFGs with the nonlocal coupling are captured. Moreover, if the localpolynomial expansions are imposed on potentials, we study the refinedasymptotic behaviors of ground states and show that they concentrate on theflattest minima of potentials.",12/4/2024,"['mathbb', 'rieszpotentials', 'refinedasymptotic', 'toergodic', 'gagliardo']"

Some lower bounds for optimal sampling recovery of functions with mixed  smoothness,"Abstract: Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of samplingrecovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done byproving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear samplingrecovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address theproblem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory ofestimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower boundsfor the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use theabove approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, isbased on some simple observations.

Wigner in 1932 and later extended by L. Cohen and others,has opened new avenues in time-frequency analysis and operator calculus.Despite substantial advancements, the presence of ``ghost frequencies"" inWigner kernels continues to pose significant challenges, particularly in theanalysis of Fourier integral operators (FIOs) and their applications to partialdifferential equations (PDEs).In this work, we build on the foundational concepts of Wigner analysis tointroduce a novel framework for controlling ghost frequencies through thecombined use of Gaussian and Sobolev regularization techniques. By focusing onFIOs with non-quadratic phase functions, we develop rigorous estimates for theWigner kernels that are crucial for their applicability to Schr\""odingerequations with non-trivial symbol classes.
